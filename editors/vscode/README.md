## `ctx`: VS Code Chat Extension

A VS Code Chat Participant that brings [ctx](https://ctx.ist) (persistent
project context for AI coding sessions) directly into GitHub Copilot Chat.

Type `@ctx` in the Chat view to access 45 slash commands, automatic context
hooks, a reminder status bar, and natural language routing, all powered by
the ctx CLI.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension (or build from source; see [Development](#development))
2. Open a project in VS Code
3. Open Copilot Chat and type `@ctx /init`

The extension auto-downloads the ctx CLI binary if it isn't on your PATH.

Sub-routes for `/system`: `resources`, `doctor`, `bootstrap`, `stats`,

## Automatic Hooks

The extension registers several VS Code event handlers that mirror
Claude Code's hook system. These run in the background; no user action
needed.

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **File save** | Runs task-completion check on non-`.context/` files |
| **Git commit** | Notification prompting to add a Decision, Learning, run Verify, or Skip |
| **`.context/` file change** | Refreshes reminders and regenerates `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Dependency file change** | Notification when `go.mod`, `package.json`, etc. change; offers `/map` |
| **Every 5 minutes** | Updates reminder status bar and writes heartbeat timestamp |
| **Extension activate** | Fires `session-event --type start` to ctx CLI |
| **Extension deactivate** | Fires `session-event --type end` to ctx CLI |

## Status Bar

A `$(bell) ctx` indicator appears in the status bar when you have pending
reminders. It updates every 5 minutes. When no reminders are due, it hides
automatically.

## Natural Language

You can also type plain English after `@ctx`: the extension routes
common phrases to the correct handler:

- "What should I work on next?" → `/next`
- "Time to wrap up" → `/wrapup`
- "Show me the status" → `/status`
- "Add a decision" → `/add`
- "Check for drift" → `/drift`

## Auto-Bootstrap

If the ctx CLI isn't found on PATH or at the configured path, the
extension automatically downloads the correct platform binary from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases):

1. Detects OS and architecture (darwin/linux/windows, amd64/arm64)
2. Fetches the latest release from the GitHub API
3. Downloads and verifies the matching binary
4. Caches it in VS Code's global storage directory

Subsequent sessions reuse the cached binary. To force a specific version,
set `ctx.executablePath` in your settings.

## Follow-Up Suggestions

After each command, Copilot Chat shows context-aware follow-up buttons.
For example:

- After `/init` → "Show status" or "Generate copilot integration"
- After `/drift` → "Sync context" or "Show status"
- After `/reflect` → "Add decision", "Add learning", or "Wrap up"
- After `/spec` → "Show implementation plan" or "Run verification"

## Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.93+
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension
- [ctx](https://ctx.ist) CLI on PATH, or let the extension auto-download it

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ctx.executablePath` | `ctx` | Path to the ctx CLI binary. Set this if ctx isn't on PATH and you don't want auto-download. |

## Development

```bash
cd editors/vscode
npm install
npm run watch   # Watch mode
npm run build   # Production build
npm test        # Run tests (53 test cases via vitest)
```

### Architecture

The extension is a single-file implementation
(`src/extension.ts`, ~3 000 lines) that:

- Registers a `ChatParticipant` with `@ctx` as the handle
- Routes slash commands to dedicated `handleXxx()` functions
- Each handler calls the ctx CLI via `execFile` and streams the output
- On Windows, uses `shell: true` so PATH resolution works without `.exe`
- Merges stdout/stderr with deduplication (Cobra prints errors to both)
- A `handleFreeform()` function maps natural language to handlers

### Testing

Tests live in `src/extension.test.ts` and use vitest with a VS Code API
mock. They verify:

- All 45 command handlers exist and are callable
- `runCtx` invokes the correct binary with correct arguments
- Platform detection returns valid GOOS/GOARCH values
- Follow-up suggestions are returned after commands
- Edge cases: missing workspace, cancellation, empty output

> **Note**: the test file currently has unresolved type errors
> (handler imports that no longer exist on `extension.ts`, and
> a `CancellationToken` mock with an out-of-date signature). The
> tests still run under vitest's loose runtime, but `tsc` against
> them fails. Tracked in TASKS.md; until fixed, the CI gate uses
> `tsconfig.ci.json` which excludes `**/*.test.ts`.

## Release

This extension is **published separately from the ctx Go binary**.
It does *not* ride along with `release.yml`. The release pipeline
is intentionally manual: a maintainer runs `vsce publish` from a
clean checkout against the `activememory` publisher account.

CI guardrails that protect this manual publish (`vscode-extension`
job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) run on every PR and push to
`main`:

- `npm ci`: clean dependency install from the committed lockfile.
- `npm run build`: esbuild bundles `src/extension.ts` to
  `dist/extension.js`. Catches bundler errors and missing imports
  at the JavaScript level.
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.ci.json`: type-checks the
  production source (`src/**/*.ts` minus test files). Catches type
  errors that esbuild silently passes through.

What CI does **not** gate yet (known gaps):

- **Tests** (`npm test`, vitest). The suite has type errors
  unrelated to the production code; until they're fixed, gating
  on vitest would force resolving them before any merge.
- **Lint** (`npm run lint`, eslint).
- **Publish dry-run** (`vsce package` to produce the `.vsix`
  artifact without uploading). Worth adding once the test gate
  is back.

Release checklist for a maintainer:

1. Bump `version` in `editors/vscode/package.json`.
2. Update `editors/vscode/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Push to a branch, open PR. The `vscode-extension` CI job must
   pass on the PR head.
4. After merge, from a clean checkout of `main`:
   ```bash
   cd editors/vscode
   npm ci
   npm run build
   npx vsce package
   npx vsce publish      # requires VS Code Marketplace token
   ```
5. Tag the release commit and push the tag (the ctx-binary release
   workflow keys on `v*` tags; the extension's tag does not need
   to match, but keeping them in lockstep simplifies support).
