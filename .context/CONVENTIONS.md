# Conventions

<!--
UPDATE WHEN:
- New pattern is established and should be followed consistently
- Existing pattern is deprecated or superseded
- Team adopts new tooling that changes workflows
- Code review reveals recurring issues that need a convention

DO NOT UPDATE FOR:
- One-off exceptions (document in code comments)
- Experimental patterns not yet proven
- Personal preferences without team consensus
-->

## Naming

- **Constants use semantic prefixes**: Group related constants with prefixes
  - `Dir*` for directories (`DirContext`, `DirArchive`)
  - `File*` for file paths (`FileSettings`, `FileClaudeMd`)
  - `Filename*` for file names only (`FilenameTask`, `FilenameDecision`)
  - `*Type*` for enum-like values (`UpdateTypeTask`, `UpdateTypeDecision`)
- **Package name = folder name**: Go canonical pattern
  - `package initialize` in `initialize/` folder
  - Never `package initcmd` in `init/` folder
- **Go package names: lowercase, no underscores, no
  mixedCaps**: per the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/blog/package-names)
  guidance and the stdlib precedent (`strconv`, `httptest`,
  `bufio`). Apply to the directory too — `internal/flagbind/`,
  not `internal/flag_bind/`. Filenames may use underscores
  (`foo_test.go` is canonical); package names may not. When in
  doubt, find the closest stdlib analogue and copy its shape.
- **Maps reference constants**: Use constants as keys, not literals
  - `map[string]X{ConstKey: value}` not `map[string]X{"literal": value}`

## Casing

- **Proper nouns keep their casing** in comments, strings, and docs
  - `Markdown` not `markdown` (it's a language name)
  - `YAML`, `JSON`, `TOML` — always uppercase
  - `GitHub`, `JavaScript`, `PostgreSQL` — match official casing
  - Exception: code fence language identifiers are lowercase (`` ```markdown ``)

## Predicates

- **No Is/Has/Can prefixes**: `Completed()` not
  `IsCompleted()`, `Empty()` not `IsEmpty()`
- Applies to exported methods that return bool
- Private helpers may use prefixes when it reads more naturally

## File Organization

- **Public API in main file, private helpers in separate logical files**
  - `loader.go` (exports `Load()`) + `process.go` (unexported helpers)
  - NOT: one file with unexported functions stacked at the bottom
- Reasoning: agent loads only the public API file unless
  it needs implementation detail
- **Name files after what they contain, not their role**
  - `format.go`, `sort.go`, `parse.go` — named by responsibility
  - NOT: `util.go`, `utils.go`, `helper.go`, `common.go` — junk drawer names
  - If a file can't be named without a generic label,
    its contents don't belong together
  - Existing junk drawers should be split as their contents grow

## Patterns

- **Centralize magic strings**: All repeated literals
  belong in a `config` or `constants` package
  - If a string appears in 3+ files, it needs a constant
  - If a string is used for comparison, it needs a constant
- **Path construction**: Always use stdlib path joining
  - Go: `filepath.Join(dir, file)`
  - Python: `os.path.join(dir, file)`
  - Node: `path.join(dir, file)`
  - Never: `dir + "/" + file`
- **Constants reference constants**: Self-referential definitions
  - `FileType[UpdateTypeTask] = FilenameTask` not
    `FileType["task"] = "TASKS.md"`
- **No error variable shadowing**: Use descriptive names
  when multiple errors exist in a function
  - `readErr`, `writeErr`, `indexErr` — not repeated `err` / `err :=`
  - Shadowed `err` silently disconnects from the outer
    variable, causing subtle bugs
- **Colocate related code**: Group by feature, not by type
  - `session/run.go`, `session/types.go`, `session/parse.go`
  - Not: `runners/session.go`, `types/session.go`, `parsers/session.go`

## Line Width

- **Target ~80 characters**: Highly encouraged, not a hard limit
  - Some lines will naturally exceed it (long strings,
    struct tags, URLs) — that's fine
  - Drift accumulates silently, especially in test code
  - Break at natural points: function arguments, struct fields, chained calls

## Duplication

- **Non-test code**: Apply the rule of three — extract
  when a block appears 3+ times
  - Watch for copy-paste during task-focused sessions
    where the agent prioritizes completion over shape
- **Test code**: Some duplication is acceptable for readability
  - When the same setup/assertion block appears 3+ times, extract a test helper
  - Use `t.Helper()` so failure messages point to the caller, not the helper

## Testing

- **Colocate tests**: Test files live next to source files
  - `foo.go` → `foo_test.go` in same package
  - Not a separate `tests/` folder
- **Test the unit, not the file**: One test file can test
  multiple related functions
- **Integration tests are separate**: `cli_test.go` for end-to-end binary tests

## Code Change Heuristics

- **Present interpretations, don't pick silently**: If a request has multiple
  valid readings, lay them out rather than guessing
- **Push back when warranted**: If a simpler approach exists, say so
- **"Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?"**: If yes, simplify
- **Match existing style**: Even if you'd write it differently in a greenfield
- **Every changed line traces to the request**: If it doesn't, revert it

## Decision Heuristics

- **"Would I start this today?"**: If not, continuing is
  the sunk cost — evaluate only future value
- **"Reversible or one-way door?"**: Reversible decisions
  don't need deep analysis
- **"Does the analysis cost more than the decision?"**:
  Stop deliberating when the options are within an order
  of magnitude
- **"Order of magnitude, not precision"**: 10x better
  matters; 10% better usually doesn't

## Refactoring

- **Measure the end state, not the effort**: When refactoring, ask what the
  codebase looks like *after*, not how much work the change is
- **Three questions before restructuring**:
  1. What's the smallest codebase that solves this?
  2. Does the proposed change result in less total code?
  3. What can we delete now that this change makes obsolete?
- **Deletion is a feature**: Writing 50 lines that delete 200 is a net win

## Documentation

- **Godoc format**: Use canonical sections
  ```go
  // FunctionName does X.
  //
  // Longer description if needed.
  //
  // Parameters:
  //   - param1: Description
  //   - param2: Description
  //
  // Returns:
  //   - Type: Description of return value
  func FunctionName(param1, param2 string) error
  ```
- **Struct field documentation**: Exported structs with 2+ fields
  must document every field. Two accepted forms:
  ```go
  // Option A: Fields section in docblock (preferred for 4+ fields)
  // TypeName describes X.
  //
  // Fields:
  //   - FieldA: Description
  //   - FieldB: Description
  type TypeName struct {

  // Option B: Inline comments (acceptable for 2-3 fields)
  // TypeName describes X.
  type TypeName struct {
      // FieldA is the description.
      FieldA string
      FieldB string // Description
  }
  ```
- **Package doc in doc.go**: Each package gets a `doc.go` with package-level
  documentation describing behavior, not structure. Do NOT include
  `# File Organization` sections listing files — they drift when files are
  added, renamed, or removed, and the filesystem is self-documenting
- **Copyright headers**: All source files get the project copyright header

## Blog Publishing

- **Checklist for ideas/ → docs/blog/ promotion**:
  1. Update date in frontmatter to publish date
  2. Fix relative paths (from `../docs/blog/` to peer references)
  3. Add cross-links to/from companion posts ("See also" sections)
  4. Add "The Arc" section connecting to the series narrative
  5. Update `docs/blog/index.md` with entry (newest first)
  6. Verify all link targets exist
  7. Build and test before commit
- **Arc section**: Every post includes "The Arc" near the end, framing
  where the post sits in the broader blog narrative
- **See also links**: Use italic `*See also: [Title](file) -- one-line
  description connecting the two posts.*` format at the end of posts
- **Frontmatter**: Include copyright header, title, date, author, topics list
- **Blog index order**: Newest post first, with topic tags and 3-4 line summary

- **Update admonitions for historical blog content**: Use MkDocs admonitions
  (`!!! note "Update"`) at the top of blog post sections where features have
  been superseded or installation has changed. Link to current documentation.
  Keep original content intact below for historical context.
- **New CLI subcommand documentation checklist**: Update docs in at least
  three places: (1) Feature page — commands table, usage section, skill/NL
  table. (2) CLI reference — full reference entry with args, flags, examples.
  (3) Relevant recipes. (4) zensical.toml — only if adding a new page.
- **Rename/refactor documentation checklist**: Scope ALL documentation impact
  before implementation. Three anchors plus one tangential: (1) Docstrings.
  (2) User-facing docs (`docs/`). (3) Recipes (`docs/recipes/`). (4) Blog
  posts and release notes. Also check: skills, hook messages, YAML text
  files, `.context/` files, and specs.
- **Stage site/ with docs/ changes**: The generated HTML is tracked in git
  with no CI build step

## Error Handling

- **Zero silent error discard**: Handle every error, never suppress with
  `_ =` or `//nolint:errcheck`. Production: defer-close logs to stderr
  via `log.Warn()`. Test: `t.Fatal(err)` for setup, `t.Log(err)` for
  cleanup. For gosec false positives: fix the code rather than adding
  nolint markers — the goal is zero golangci-lint suppressions
- **Error constructors in internal/err**: Never in per-package err.go
  files — eliminates the broken-window pattern where agents add local
  errors when they see a local err.go exists
- **Identity sentinels are `entity.Sentinel` consts, not
  `errors.New`**: Declare `errors.Is` targets as
  `const ErrX = entity.Sentinel(text.DescKey...)`. The
  user-facing text lives in `commands/text/errors.yaml` keyed by
  `err.<pkg>.<name>`; the sentinel's `Error()` resolves it via
  `desc.Text` at call time. Never write
  `var ErrX = errors.New("english")` — the English leaks into
  `.Error()` output and bypasses localization. Never add an
  `ErrMsg* = "english"` const layer in `internal/config/<pkg>/`
  to back the sentinel; that layer is dead text once the typed
  Sentinel does the lookup itself.
- **Parameterised errors use typed structs**: When the error
  needs to carry fields (path, name, etc.), define a struct in
  `internal/err/<area>/` with a pointer-receiver `Error()` and
  optional `Is(error) bool` for sentinel-compatibility. See
  `internal/err/context.NotFoundError` for the canonical shape.

## CLI Structure

- **CLI package taxonomy**: Every package under `internal/cli/` follows:
  parent.go (Cmd wiring), doc.go, `cmd/root/` or `cmd/<sub>/`
  (implementation), `core/` (shared helpers)
- **cmd/ directories**: Only cmd.go, run.go, and tests — helpers and
  output go to `core/`
- **core/ structs**: Consolidated into a single `types.go` file
- **User-facing text via assets**: All text routed through
  `internal/assets` with YAML-backed TextDescKeys — no inline strings
  in `core/` or `cmd/` packages
- **config/ doc.go**: Every package under `internal/config/` must have
  a doc.go with the project header and a one-line package comment
- **DescKey prefix**: Not CmdDescKey — `cmd.DescKeyFoo` not
  `cmd.CmdDescKeyFoo` (Go package hygiene, avoids stutter)
- **Cobra Use: fields**: Must reference `cmd.Use*` constants, never raw
  strings or `cmd.DescKey*`
- **Run functions exported PascalCase**: `Run`, `RunImport`,
  `RunArchive` etc. No private `runXXX` variants
- **write/ packages write to stdio only**: Functions take
  `*cobra.Command`, not `io.Writer`. Exception: `write/rc` writes to
  `os.Stderr` because rc loads before cobra
- **Package directory names singular**: Unless Go convention requires
  plural
- **Import grouping**: stdlib — blank line — external deps (cobra,
  yaml) — blank line — ctx imports. Three groups, always in this order
- **camelCase import aliases**: `cFlag` not `cflag`, `cfgFmt` not
  `cfgfmt`
- **Icons and symbols as token constants**: Not unicode escapes
- **Cross-cutting domain types in internal/entity**: Types used by one
  package stay in that package; types used across packages go to entity

- Warn format strings centralized in config/warn/ — use warn.Close,
  warn.Write, warn.Remove, warn.Mkdir, warn.Rename, warn.Walk, warn.Getwd,
  warn.Readdir, warn.Marshal instead of inline format strings in log.Warn calls

- Nav frontmatter title: fields must not contain ctx — frontmatter does not
  support backticks, so the brand stays out of nav titles entirely (Hub, not The
  ctx Hub). Body headings can use `ctx` since markdown supports backticks.

- CLI flags and slash-commands inside headings or admonition titles must be
  backticked: `--keep-frontmatter=false`, `/ctx-reflect`. The title-case engine
  in hack/title-case-headings.py protects these patterns automatically, but
  authors should still backtick at write time for clarity.

- File extensions inside headings must be backticked when title-case
  capitalization would otherwise apply: write `CONSTITUTION.md`, not
  CONSTITUTION.Md. The title-case engine refuses to capitalize lowercase tokens
  following a literal . dot, but explicit backticks remain the clearest signal.
- New editor integrations include an MCP-merge test covering: create / empty
  file / preserve existing keys / skip when registered / reject malformed JSON
