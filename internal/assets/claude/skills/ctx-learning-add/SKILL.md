Record a learning in LEARNINGS.md.

## Before Recording

Three questions: if any answer is "no", don't record:

1. **"Could someone Google this in 5 minutes?"** → If yes, skip it
2. **"Is this specific to this codebase?"** → If no, skip it
3. **"Did it take real effort to discover?"** → If no, skip it

Learnings should capture **principles and heuristics**, not code snippets.

## When to Use

- After discovering a gotcha or unexpected behavior
- When a debugging session reveals root cause
- When finding a pattern that will help future work

## When NOT to Use

- General programming knowledge (not specific to this project)
- One-off workarounds that won't recur
- Things already documented in the codebase

## Gathering Information

If the user provides only a title, ask:

1. "What were you doing when you discovered this?" → Context
2. "What's the key insight?" → Lesson
3. "How should we handle this going forward?" → Application

## Execution

Provenance flags (`--session-id`, `--branch`, `--commit`) are **required**.
Get these values from the hook-relayed provenance line in your context
(e.g., `Session: abc12345 | Branch: main @ 68fbc00a`).

**Prefer this skill over raw `ctx learning add`**: the conversational
approach lets you automatically pick up session ID, branch, and commit
from the provenance line already in your context window.

```bash
ctx learning add "Title" \
  --session-id SESSION --branch BRANCH --commit HASH \
  --context "..." --lesson "..." --application "..."
```

**Example: behavioral pattern:**
```bash
ctx learning add "Agent ignores repeated hook output (repetition fatigue)" \
  --session-id abc12345 --branch main --commit 68fbc00a \
  --context "PreToolUse hook ran ctx agent on every tool use, injecting the same context packet repeatedly. Agent tuned it out and didn't follow conventions." \
  --lesson "Repeated injection causes the agent to ignore the output. A cooldown tombstone emits once per window. A readback instruction creates a behavioral gate harder to skip than silent injection." \
  --application "Use --session \$PPID in hook commands to enable cooldown. Pair context injection with a readback instruction."
```

**Example: technical gotcha:**
```bash
ctx learning add "go:embed only works with files in same or child directories" \
  --session-id abc12345 --branch main --commit 68fbc00a \
  --context "Tried to embed files from parent directory, got compile error" \
  --lesson "go:embed paths are relative to the source file and cannot use .. to escape the package" \
  --application "Keep embedded files in internal/assets/ or child directories, not project root"
```

**Example: workflow insight:**
```bash
ctx learning add "ctx init overwrites user content without guard" \
  --session-id abc12345 --branch main --commit 68fbc00a \
  --context "Commit a9df9dd wiped 18 decisions from DECISIONS.md, replacing with empty template" \
  --lesson "Init treats all context files as templates, but after first use they contain user data" \
  --application "Skip existing files by default, only overwrite with --force"
```

## Authority boundary (vs other skills)

This skill records principle-level lessons discovered through real
work. It does not unilaterally promote material from adjacent skills:

- **Do not promote a learning into a convention.** A learning is
  "this gotcha cost us time" — generalizing it into "we always do
  X" is `/ctx-convention-add`'s job and requires explicit user ask.
- **Do not promote a learning into a decision.** Even when the
  lesson clarifies a trade-off, the trade-off itself belongs in
  `/ctx-decision-add` if the user wants it elevated.
- **Do not record general programming knowledge.** Anything
  Googleable in five minutes is not a learning for this codebase
  (the "Before Recording" check enforces this).

Light compression for clarity is allowed; new facts are not.

## Quality Checklist

Before recording, verify:
- [ ] Context explains what happened (not just what you learned)
- [ ] Lesson is a principle, not a code snippet
- [ ] Application gives actionable guidance for next time
- [ ] Not already in LEARNINGS.md (check first)

Confirm the learning was added.
