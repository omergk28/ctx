# Ground the KB Against Its Tracked Sources

Walk the sources declared in `.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md`
and report whether the kb's claims are still current. This is the
*"are we still current?"* pass — a **read-only freshness audit**,
not a re-ingest.

Each tracked source — **URLs, in-tree paths, or MCP resources** —
gets resolved and classified as `unchanged`, `drifted`, `gone`,
`freshness opaque`, or `new to kb`. The skill annotates the
source-coverage ledger's `Residue` and `Next action` cells and
writes a ground closeout summarising findings. It does **NOT**
mint `EV-###` rows, author topic-page prose, transition ledger
states, or modify Confidence bands; those are `/ctx-kb-ingest`'s
authority.

If a tracked source drifted or is new to the kb, this skill flags
it and recommends a follow-up `/ctx-kb-ingest`. The declarative
watch list in `grounding-sources.md` is what makes this skill
distinct from ingest: it **persists across sessions** (ingest's
source list is per-invocation) and tracks sources from anywhere
the kb cites — public web, this repo's tree, behind an MCP
server. Distance from the repo is irrelevant; what matters is
that the kb depends on them for evidence.

Authoritative background reading:
`.context/ingest/KB-RULES.md` §Authority boundary and
§Source-coverage ledger; `specs/kb-editorial-pipeline.md`
§Interface and §Edge Cases.

## When to Use

- The user says "re-ground the kb", "check upstream",
  "are the docs still current?", or invokes the explicit slash
  form.
- Before a release / handover where source freshness matters.
- After an external vendor has shipped a version bump.
- Periodically (per the user's cadence) as kb hygiene.

## When NOT to Use

- The user has new materials in hand (use `/ctx-kb-ingest`).
- The user is asking a content question (use `/ctx-kb-ask`).
- The user wants a structural audit (use `/ctx-kb-site-review`).

## Authority Boundary (vs Other Skills)

- **`/ctx-kb-ground`**: read-only freshness audit over the
  sources listed in `grounding-sources.md` (URLs, in-tree paths,
  MCP resources). Annotates the source-coverage ledger's
  `Residue` and `Next action` cells; writes a ground closeout.
  **May not** mint `EV-###` rows, author prose, modify a topic
  page, change a Confidence band, or transition ledger states.
- **`/ctx-kb-ingest`**: handles anything this skill surfaces
  as new material to absorb.
- **`/ctx-kb-ask`**: handles read-only questions about kb
  content.
- **`/ctx-kb-site-review`**: handles structural audit (separate
  surface from source-freshness audit).

## Usage Examples

```text
/ctx-kb-ground
```

No arguments. Sources come from
`.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md`.

## Input Contract

The file `.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md` is the sole
declaration surface. Each non-empty, non-comment line names a
source (URL, in-tree path, MCP resource identifier) the user
wants this skill to track. A line whose value is the literal
`NONE` is a **per-pass skip**: this invocation does nothing and
re-prompts on the next invocation. Lines beginning with `#` are
comments.

There is no CLI argument for sources. To configure what this
skill checks, edit `grounding-sources.md`.

## Pre-Write Gates

Three distinct refusals, each leaves zero residue:

- `.context/` missing → suggest `ctx init` and stop.
- `.context/ingest/` missing → suggest `ctx init --upgrade`
  and stop.
- Kb scope undeclared → refuse with the scope message and stop.

## Refuse-on-Empty

`.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md` may be in three states:

1. **Missing or empty**: file does not exist, or has only
   comments and blank lines. Prompt once:

   > `grounding-sources.md` has no sources. List one source per
   > line (URL, in-tree path, MCP resource). `NONE` on a line
   > is a per-pass skip and re-prompts next invocation.

   Stop. Do not synthesize a list. Do not invent sources from
   the kb's `source-map.md` (that file's authority is ingest;
   grounding's declaration surface is separate by design).

2. **Single line `NONE`**: per-pass skip. Write no closeout;
   return exactly:

   > grounding-sources.md is `NONE` for this pass; skipping.
   > Edit `.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md` to set actual
   > sources, or leave `NONE` to keep skipping.

   The next invocation re-prompts as in (1) above.

3. **One or more sources listed**: proceed to Process.

The empty-and-prompt path is the one exception to the
refuse-on-empty pattern other mode skills enforce; the rationale
is that grounding's declaration lives in a file the user owns
(not in a slash argument), so a one-shot prompt is cheaper than
forcing them to remember the filename.

## Process

1. **Verify pre-write gates.** Refuse cleanly if any gate fails.
   Zero residue on refusal.

2. **Read `.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md`.** Handle the
   three states per §Refuse-on-empty.

3. **For each declared source**, in order of appearance:

   - **Resolve** the source: fetch the URL, stat the in-tree
     path, enumerate the MCP resource.
   - **Cross-reference** against `.context/kb/source-map.md` to
     find the kb's short-name for this source (if any). If
     absent, the source is *new to the kb*; record it as a flag
     to surface in the closeout (do not mint a `source-map.md`
     row; that is ingest's authority).
   - **Check freshness** using the strongest available signal:
     - URL: HTTP Last-Modified header, or ETag, or visible
       version stamp on the page; compare against the
       `source-map.md` row's `dated:` cell (if present).
     - In-tree path: file mtime + git SHA; compare against the
       `evidence-index.md` rows that cite the source by SHA
       (in-repo citations pin to a SHA at extraction time per
       `KB-RULES.md` §Evidence discipline).
     - MCP resource: whatever freshness primitive the resource
       exposes; if none, treat as opaque (record as
       *"freshness opaque"* in the closeout).
   - **Classify the refresh outcome** as one of:
     - **`unchanged`**: source has not drifted since the
       kb's last extraction; no ledger update needed.
     - **`drifted`**: source has changed; the kb's claims
       citing this source may be stale; advance the ledger row
       to a state that reflects the staleness:
       - If the row was `comprehensive`, advance to a typed
         `superseded-pending` annotation in the `Residue` cell
         (do not write a new state name; the state machine in
         `KB-RULES.md` is closed; `Residue` is the
         human-readable annotation surface).
       - If the row was anywhere prior to `comprehensive`,
         leave the state and add a `drifted` note in `Residue`
         + `Next action` set to the explicit
         `/ctx-kb-ingest <slug>` resumption.
     - **`gone`**: source returns 404, file deleted, MCP
       resource removed; flag for the user. The right
       resolution may be `superseded` (with a named successor)
       or `skipped` (out of scope); that judgment is the
       user's, not this skill's.
     - **`freshness opaque`**: no freshness signal available;
       record in `Residue` cell as *"freshness opaque
       (<date checked>)"*; no ledger state change.
   - **Advance the ledger row** only for `drifted` and `gone`
     cases, and only via `Residue` / `Next action` annotation
     (not state change). State transitions out of `comprehensive`
     are ingest's authority.

4. **Write the ground closeout.** Create
   `.context/ingest/closeouts/<TIMESTAMP>-ground-closeout.md`
   with required frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   sha: <short>
   branch: <name>
   mode: ground
   pass-mode: refresh
   life-stage: <bootstrap|maintenance>
   generated-at: <RFC-3339>
   ---
   ```

   Body sections:
   - **Inputs**: declared sources from
     `grounding-sources.md`, count + one bullet each.
   - **Refresh outcomes**: for each source: `unchanged`,
     `drifted`, `gone`, `freshness opaque`, or `new to kb`.
     Cite the kb short-name (or *"new to kb"*) and the
     evidence used to classify (Last-Modified header, version
     stamp, file mtime).
   - **Ledger updates**: every `Residue` / `Next action`
     change applied to a `source-coverage.md` row, with the
     before/after annotation.
   - **Flags**: sources the refresh found `gone`, sources
     classified `new to kb`, sources with conflicting
     freshness signals. Each flag names the source and the
     recommended next pipeline step.
   - **Next pass hint**: explicit invocations to absorb
     drifted / new material (e.g. *"`/ctx-kb-ingest <slug>` to
     refresh `cursor/hooks` against the v1.2 docs"*).

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| `grounding-sources.md` missing or empty (only comments/blank) | Prompt once with the standard text; stop. No closeout. |
| `grounding-sources.md` single line `NONE` | Skip this pass with the standard skip text; stop. No closeout. |
| `.context/` missing | Refuse; suggest `ctx init`. No residue. |
| `.context/ingest/` missing | Refuse; suggest `ctx init --upgrade`. No residue. |
| Kb scope undeclared | Refuse with the scope message. No residue. |
| Source returns 404 / file deleted / MCP resource removed | Classify `gone`; flag; recommend the user choose `superseded` (with successor) or `skipped` (out of scope). Do not auto-transition. |
| Source unchanged since last extraction | Record `unchanged` in closeout's `Refresh outcomes`; no ledger update. |
| Source drifted since last extraction (URL bumped, file mtime newer than cited SHA) | Record `drifted`; annotate ledger row's `Residue` / `Next action`; recommend `/ctx-kb-ingest <slug>`. Do not modify topic-page prose. |
| Source has no freshness primitive (opaque) | Record `freshness opaque (<date checked>)`; no ledger state change; surface in `Flags` so the user can decide cadence. |
| Source listed in `grounding-sources.md` but not in `source-map.md` (new to kb) | Classify `new to kb`; flag; recommend `/ctx-kb-ingest <source>` to admit. Do not mint a `source-map.md` row from this skill. |
| Source listed in `grounding-sources.md` but URL malformed or path nonexistent | Surface as a per-source error in the closeout's `Flags`; continue with remaining sources; do not abort the pass. |
| Source's `source-map.md` row has `dated:` but `evidence-index.md` rows lack `occurred:` | Flag (temporal-precedence rule needs it); recommend hand-edit. Do not auto-edit. |
| User added a new source to `grounding-sources.md` since the last pass | Treated as a regular declared source; classified per the freshness check; no special path. |
| Mid-pass MCP fetch failure | Record per-source error; continue; do not abort the whole pass. |

## Anti-Patterns

- Minting `EV-###` rows from this skill. Evidence authoring is
  ingest's authority.
- Authoring topic-page prose from this skill. Page authoring is
  ingest's authority.
- Modifying a claim's Confidence band from this skill. Demotion
  is evidence work.
- Auto-transitioning a `comprehensive` ledger row out of
  `comprehensive`. State changes require ingest judgment; this
  skill annotates `Residue` / `Next action` only.
- Synthesising a source list when `grounding-sources.md` is
  empty. The declaration surface is the file the user owns.
- Inventing a freshness signal when none exists. *"Freshness
  opaque"* is the honest classification.
- Skipping the closeout once pre-write gates pass and at least
  one source was processed.

## Output Contract

For pre-write refusals, return only the specified refusal text
and stop. No residue.

For empty / `NONE` cases, return the matching prompt or skip
text and stop. No closeout in those cases.

For passes that processed at least one source, end with this
structured summary:

- **Sources checked**: count + one bullet each, classified
  (`unchanged | drifted | gone | freshness opaque | new to kb`).
- **Ledger updates**: count + one-line categories.
- **Flags**: count + categories.
- **Closeout**: filename on its own line.
- **Next-recommended-action**: explicit invocations to absorb
  drifted / new material (or `none` if every source was
  `unchanged`).

## Quality Checklist

Before reporting completion, verify:

- [ ] Pre-write gates passed (or the matching refusal was
      returned with zero residue).
- [ ] Every declared source from `grounding-sources.md` was
      checked, classified, and recorded in `Refresh outcomes`.
- [ ] No `EV-###` row was minted, no topic-page prose was
      written, no Confidence band was changed, no ledger state
      was transitioned (only `Residue` / `Next action`
      annotated).
- [ ] Every `drifted` / `gone` / `new to kb` source has an
      explicit `Next-recommended-action`.
- [ ] Closeout written with all required frontmatter fields.
