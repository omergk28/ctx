Guide end-of-session context persistence. Gather signal from the
session, propose candidates worth persisting, and persist approved
items via `ctx add`.

This is a **ceremony skill**: invoke it explicitly as `/ctx-wrap-up`
at session end, not conversationally. It pairs with `/ctx-remember`
at session start.

## Before Starting

Check that the context directory exists. If it does not, tell the user:
"No context directory found. Run `ctx init` to set up context
tracking, then there will be something to wrap up."

## Handover Is the Mandatory Final Step

`/ctx-wrap-up` owns the user-facing session-end trigger and
**always** delegates to `/ctx-handover` as its final step.
The handover is the former agent's note to the next agent
(or human): what happened, and what should come next. It
writes `.context/handovers/<TS>-<slug>.md` (timestamped so
multiple agent runs never overwrite). Without this final
step, `/ctx-remember` has nothing to read at the start of
the next session and recall degenerates into probabilistic
reconstruction from canonical files plus journal.

## KB Editorial State (Phase KB, Optional)

If `.context/kb/` exists, this project additionally uses the
editorial pipeline. After the capture phase but before the
final `/ctx-handover` delegation:

1. List any closeouts under `.context/ingest/closeouts/`.
   These are per-pass audit artifacts from `/ctx-kb-ingest`,
   `/ctx-kb-ask`, etc. that have not yet been folded into a
   handover.
2. Count unresolved entries in
   `.context/kb/outstanding-questions.md` (rows whose Status
   is `open`).
3. Surface both counts in the wrap-up summary so the operator
   sees what editorial residue is pending; the handover
   step's fold pass will consume the closeouts.

When `.context/kb/` does NOT exist, skip this section
entirely; the wrap-up proceeds with the standard capture
checklist and still ends with `/ctx-handover`.

## When to Use

- At the end of a session, before the user quits
- When the user says "let's wrap up", "save context", "end of
  session"
- When the `check-persistence` hook suggests it

## When NOT to Use

- Nothing meaningful happened (only read files, quick lookup)
- The user already persisted everything manually with `ctx add`
- Mid-session when the user is still in flow: use `/ctx-reflect`
  instead for mid-session checkpoints

## Process

### Phase 1: Gather signal

Do this **silently**: do not narrate the steps:

1. Check what changed in the working tree:
   ```bash
   git diff --stat
   ```
2. Check commits made this session:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline @{upstream}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline -5
   ```
3. Scan the conversation history for:
   - Architectural choices or design trade-offs discussed
   - Gotchas, bugs, or unexpected behavior encountered
   - Patterns established or conventions agreed upon
   - Follow-up work identified but not yet started
   - Tasks completed or progressed

### Phase 2: Propose candidates

Think step-by-step about what is worth persisting. For each
potential candidate, ask yourself:
- Is this project-specific or general knowledge? (Only persist
  project-specific insights)
- Would a future session benefit from knowing this?
- Is this already captured in the context files?
- Is this substantial enough to record, or is it trivial?

Present candidates in a structured list, grouped by type.
Skip categories with no candidates: do not show empty sections.

```
## Session Wrap-Up

### Learnings (N candidates)
1. **Title of learning**
   - Context: What prompted this
   - Lesson: The key insight
   - Application: How to apply it going forward

### Decisions (N candidates)
1. **Title of decision**
   - Context: What prompted this
   - Rationale: Why this choice
   - Consequence: What changes as a result

### Conventions (N candidates)
1. **Convention description**

### Tasks (N candidates)
1. **Task description** (new | completed | updated)

Persist all? Or select which to keep?
```

### Phase 3: Persist approved candidates

Wait for the user to approve, select, or modify candidates.
Wait for the user to approve each item before persisting:
candidates proposed by the agent may be incomplete or
mischaracterized, and the user is the final authority on what
belongs in their context.

For each approved candidate, run the appropriate command:

| Type        | Command                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learning    | `ctx learning add "Title" --session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH --context "..." --lesson "..." --application "..."`    |
| Decision    | `ctx decision add "Title" --session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH --context "..." --rationale "..." --consequence "..."` |
| Convention  | `ctx convention add "Description"`                                                                                               |
| Task (new)  | `ctx task add "Description" --session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH`                                                     |
| Task (done) | Edit TASKS.md to mark complete                                                   |

Report the result of each command. If any fail, report the error
and continue with the remaining items.

### Phase 3.5: Suppress post-wrap-up nudges

After persisting, mark the session as wrapped up so checkpoint
nudges are suppressed for the remainder of the session:

```bash
ctx system mark-wrapped-up
```

### Phase 4: Surface Uncommitted Changes

After persisting, check for uncommitted changes:

```bash
git status --short
```

When `git status --short` reports any modified or untracked
files, surface them and offer `/ctx-commit`:

> There are uncommitted changes (`<count>` files). Run
> `/ctx-commit` to commit with context capture?

Do not auto-commit; the user decides. But always run the
`git status` check and always surface non-empty output. Do
not skip this phase silently when the working tree is dirty.

### Phase 5: Delegate to `/ctx-handover` (mandatory)

`/ctx-wrap-up` always ends here. Drafting the handover reuses
the signal gathered in Phase 1 and the candidates approved in
Phase 3:

1. **Title**: a short noun phrase naming the session arc
   (becomes the slug in `<TS>-<slug>.md`). Drawn from the
   conversation; confirm with the user.
2. **`--summary`** (required, past tense): one paragraph
   naming what was done this session, drawn from the approved
   candidates and the git-log scan. Concrete, not vague.
3. **`--next`** (required, future tense): one paragraph
   naming the specific first action the next agent should
   take. Pull from the highest-priority pending task in
   TASKS.md or the open thread the session was on.
4. **`--highlights`**: draft a bullet list of notable
   artifacts produced this session (commits, decisions,
   specs, files created). Always present a draft. Pass an
   empty string only after the user has explicitly said
   there is nothing to highlight.
5. **`--open-questions`**: draft a bullet list of things
   that remain undecided. Pull from any candidate the user
   did not turn into a decision, any deferred ingest pass,
   any `TODO` discovered in the session. Always present a
   draft. Pass an empty string only after the user has
   explicitly confirmed there is nothing open.

Surface the drafted values to the user for one final
confirmation, then delegate:

```text
/ctx-handover "<title>" --summary "<...>" --next "<...>" \
  [--highlights "<...>"] [--open-questions "<...>"]
```

The `/ctx-handover` skill performs the pre-write gates,
writes `.context/handovers/<TS>-<slug>.md`, and (when
`.context/kb/` exists) folds postdated closeouts into the
`## Folded Closeouts` section and archives them. See
[`/ctx-handover`](#) for the full input contract and CLI
flag reference.

If `/ctx-handover` refuses (missing `.context/handovers/`,
empty placeholder values, etc.), surface the refusal to the
user. Do not declare the wrap-up complete until the handover
landed.

## Candidate Quality Guide

### Good candidates

- "PyMdownx `details` extension wraps content in `<details>`
  tags, breaking `<pre><code>` rendering in MkDocs": specific
  gotcha, actionable for future sessions
- "Decision: use file-based cooldown tokens instead of env vars
  because hooks run in subprocesses": real trade-off with
  rationale
- "Convention: all skill descriptions use imperative mood":
  codifies a pattern for consistency

### Weak candidates (do not propose)

- "Go has good error handling": general knowledge, not
  project-specific
- "We edited main.go": obvious from the diff, not an insight
- "Tests should pass before committing": too generic to be
  useful
- Anything already present in LEARNINGS.md or DECISIONS.md

## Relationship to /ctx-reflect

`/ctx-reflect` is for mid-session checkpoints at natural
breakpoints. `/ctx-wrap-up` is for end-of-session: it's more
thorough, covers the full session arc, and includes the commit
offer. If the user already ran `/ctx-reflect` recently, avoid
proposing the same candidates again.

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting candidates, verify:
- [ ] Signal was gathered (git diff, git log, conversation scan)
- [ ] Every candidate has complete fields (not just a title)
- [ ] Candidates are project-specific, not general knowledge
- [ ] No duplicates with existing context files
- [ ] Empty categories are omitted, not shown as "(none)"
- [ ] User is asked before anything is persisted

After persisting, verify:
- [ ] Each `ctx add` command succeeded
- [ ] Uncommitted changes were surfaced (if any)
- [ ] User was offered `/ctx-commit` (if applicable)
- [ ] `/ctx-handover` was invoked and the resulting
      `.context/handovers/<TS>-<slug>.md` was written
