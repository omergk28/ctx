Stories, insights, and lessons learned from **building** and **using** `ctx`.

---

## Releases

### [`ctx` v0.8.0: The Architecture Release](2026-03-23-ctx-v0.8.0-the-architecture-release.md)

*March 23, 2026*: 374 commits, 1,708 Go files touched, and a near-complete
architectural overhaul. Every CLI package restructured into `cmd/ + core/`
taxonomy, all user-facing strings externalized to YAML, MCP server for
tool-agnostic AI integration, and the memory bridge connecting Claude Code's
auto-memory to `.context/`.

**Topics**: release, architecture, refactoring, MCP, localization

---

## Field Notes

### [The Watermelon-Rind Anti-Pattern: Why Smarter Tools Make Shallower Agents](2026-04-06-the-watermelon-rind-anti-pattern.md)

*April 6, 2026*: Give an agent a graph query tool, and it produces output
that's structurally correct but substantively hollow (the **watermelon-rind
antipattern**: We ran three sessions analyzing the same codebase with
different tool access: the one with no tools produced 5.2x more depth.
The fix: **a two-pass compiler** for architecture understanding: force code
reading first, verify with tools second. Constraint is the feature.

**Topics**: architecture, code intelligence, agent behavior, design patterns, field notes

---

### [Code Structure as an Agent Interface: What 19 AST Tests Taught Us](2026-04-02-code-structure-as-an-agent-interface.md)

*April 2, 2026*: We built 19 AST-based audit tests in a single session,
touching 300+ files. In the process we discovered that "old-school" code
quality constraints (*no magic numbers, centralized error handling,
80-char lines, documentation*) are exactly the constraints that make code
readable to AI agents. If an agent interacts with your codebase, your
codebase already is an interface. You just have not designed it as one.

**Topics**: ast, code quality, agent readability, conventions, field notes

---

### [We Broke the 3:1 Rule](2026-03-23-we-broke-the-3-1-rule.md)

*March 23, 2026*: After v0.6.0, we ran 198 feature commits across 17 days
before consolidating. The 3:1 rule says consolidate every 4th session. We
did it after the 66th. The result: an 18-day, 181-commit cleanup marathon
that took longer than the feature run itself. A follow-up to
[The 3:1 Ratio](2026-02-17-the-3-1-ratio.md) with empirical evidence from
the v0.8.0 cycle.

**Topics**: consolidation, technical debt, development workflow, convention
drift, field notes

---

## Context Engineering

### [Agent Memory Is Infrastructure](2026-03-04-agent-memory-is-infrastructure.md)

*March 4, 2026*: Every AI coding agent starts fresh. The obvious fix is
"*memory.*" But there's a different problem memory doesn't touch: the project
itself **accumulates knowledge** that has nothing to do with any single session.
This post argues that agent memory is L2 (runtime cache); what's missing is
L3 (project infrastructure).

**Topics**: context engineering, agent memory, infrastructure, persistence,
team knowledge

---

### [Context as Infrastructure](2026-02-17-context-as-infrastructure.md)

*February 17, 2026*: Where does your AI's knowledge live between sessions?
If the answer is "*in a prompt I paste at the start,*" you are treating context
as a consumable. This post argues for treating it as infrastructure instead:
persistent files, separation of concerns, two-tier storage, **progressive
disclosure**, and the filesystem as the most mature interface available.

**Topics**: context engineering, infrastructure, progressive disclosure,
persistence, design philosophy

---

### [The Attention Budget: Why Your AI Forgets What You Just Told It](2026-02-03-the-attention-budget.md)

*February 3, 2026*: Every token you send to an AI consumes a finite
resource: the **attention budget**. Understanding this constraint shaped every
design decision in `ctx`: hierarchical file structure, explicit budgets,
progressive disclosure, and filesystem-as-index.

**Topics**: attention mechanics, context engineering, progressive disclosure,
`ctx` primitives, token budgets

---

### [Before Context Windows, We Had Bouncers](2026-02-14-irc-as-context.md)

*February 14, 2026*: IRC is stateless. You disconnect, you vanish. Modern
systems are not much different. This post traces the line from IRC bouncers
to **context engineering**: stateless protocols require stateful wrappers,
volatile interfaces require durable memory.

**Topics**: context engineering, infrastructure, IRC, persistence,
state continuity

---

### [The Last Question](2026-02-28-the-last-question.md)

*February 28, 2026*: In 1956, Asimov wrote a story about a question that
spans the entire future of the universe. A reading of "*The Last Question*"
through the lens of persistence, substrate migration, and what it means to
build systems where **sessions don't reset**.

**Topics**: context continuity, long-lived systems, persistence,
intelligence over time, field notes

---

## Agent Behavior and Design

### [The Dog Ate My Homework: Teaching AI Agents to Read Before They Write](2026-02-25-the-homework-problem.md)

*February 25, 2026*: You wrote the playbook. The agent skipped all of it.
Five sessions, five failure modes, and the discovery that **observable
compliance** beats perfect compliance.

**Topics**: hooks, agent behavior, context engineering, behavioral design,
testing methodology, compliance monitoring

---

### [Skills That Fight the Platform](2026-02-04-skills-that-fight-the-platform.md)

*February 4, 2026*: When custom skills conflict with system prompt defaults,
the AI has to reconcile contradictory instructions. Five **conflict patterns**
discovered while building `ctx`.

**Topics**: context engineering, skill design, system prompts, antipatterns,
AI safety primitives

---

### [The Anatomy of a Skill That Works](2026-02-07-the-anatomy-of-a-skill-that-works.md)

*February 7, 2026*: I had 20 skills. Most were well-intentioned stubs. Then
I rewrote all of them. Seven lessons emerged: quality gates prevent premature
execution, negative triggers are load-bearing, **examples set boundaries better
than rules**.

**Topics**: skill design, context engineering, quality gates, E/A/R framework,
practical patterns

---

### [You Can't Import Expertise](2026-02-05-you-cant-import-expertise.md)

*February 5, 2026*: I found a well-crafted consolidation skill. Applied my
own E/A/R framework: 70% was noise. This post is about why **good skills can't
be copy-pasted**, and how to grow them from your project's own drift history.

**Topics**: skill adaptation, E/A/R framework, convention drift, consolidation,
project-specific expertise

---

### [Not Everything Is a Skill](2026-02-08-not-everything-is-a-skill.md)

*February 8, 2026*: I ran an 8-agent codebase audit and got actionable
results. The natural instinct was to wrap the prompt as a skill. Then I
applied my own criteria: it **failed** all three tests.

**Topics**: skill design, context engineering, automation discipline,
recipes, agent teams

---

### [Defense in Depth: Securing AI Agents](2026-02-09-defense-in-depth-securing-ai-agents.md)

*February 9, 2026*: The security advice was "*use CONSTITUTION.md for
guardrails.*" That is wishful thinking. **Five defense layers** for unattended
AI agents, each with a bypass, and why the strength is in the combination.

**Topics**: agent security, defense in depth, prompt injection,
autonomous loops, container isolation

---

## Development Practice

### [Code Is Cheap. Judgment Is Not.](2026-02-17-code-is-cheap-judgment-is-not.md)

*February 17, 2026*: AI does not replace workers. It replaces unstructured
effort. Three weeks of building `ctx` with an AI agent proved it: YOLO mode
showed production is cheap, **the 3:1 ratio** showed judgment has a cadence.

**Topics**: AI and expertise, context engineering, judgment vs production,
human-AI collaboration, automation discipline

---

### [The 3:1 Ratio](2026-02-17-the-3-1-ratio.md)

*February 17, 2026*: AI makes technical debt worse: not because it writes
bad code, but because it writes code so fast that **drift accumulates** before
you notice. Three feature sessions, one consolidation session.

**Topics**: consolidation, technical debt, development workflow, convention
drift, code quality

---

### [Refactoring with Intent: Human-Guided Sessions in AI Development](2026-02-01-refactoring-with-intent.md)

*February 1, 2026*: The YOLO mode shipped 14 commands in a week. But
technical debt doesn't send invoices. This is the story of what happened
when we started guiding the AI with **intent**.

**Topics**: refactoring, code quality, documentation standards, module
decomposition, YOLO versus intentional development

---

### [How Deep Is Too Deep?](2026-02-12-how-deep-is-too-deep.md)

*February 12, 2026*: I kept feeling like I should go deeper into ML theory.
Then I spent a week debugging an agent failure that had nothing to do with
model architecture. When **depth compounds** and when it **doesn't**.

**Topics**: AI foundations, abstraction boundaries, agentic systems,
context engineering, failure modes

---

## Agent Workflows

### [Parallel Agents, Merge Debt, and the Myth of Overnight Progress](2026-02-17-parallel-agents-merge-debt-and-the-myth-of-overnight-progress.md)

*February 17, 2026*: You discover agents can run in parallel. So you open
ten terminals. It is not progress: it is merge debt being manufactured in
real time. The **five-agent ceiling** and why role separation beats file locking.

**Topics**: agent workflows, parallelism, verification, context
engineering, engineering practice

---

### [Parallel Agents with Git Worktrees](2026-02-14-parallel-agents-with-worktrees.md)

*February 14, 2026*: I had 30 open tasks that didn't touch the same files.
Using **git worktrees** to partition a backlog by file overlap, run 3-4 agents
simultaneously, and merge the results.

**Topics**: agent teams, parallelism, git worktrees, context engineering,
task management

---

## Field Notes and Signals

### [When a System Starts Explaining Itself](2026-02-17-when-a-system-starts-explaining-itself.md)

*February 17, 2026*: Every new substrate begins as a private advantage.
Reality begins when other people start describing it in their own language.
"*Better than Adderall*" is not praise; it is a **diagnostic**.

**Topics**: field notes, adoption signals, infrastructure vs tools,
context engineering, substrates

---

### [Why Zensical](2026-02-15-why-zensical.md)

*February 15, 2026*: I needed a static site generator for the journal
system. The instinct was Hugo. But **instinct is not analysis**. Why zensical
was the right choice: thin dependencies, MkDocs-compatible config, and
zero lock-in.

**Topics**: tooling, static site generators, journal system,
infrastructure decisions, context engineering

---

## Releases

memory, using that very same tool to remember what you're building? This is
the **story** of `ctx`.

**Topics**: dogfooding, AI-assisted development, Ralph Loop, session
persistence, architectural decisions
