## Why Markdown?

Markdown is human-readable, version-controllable, and tool-agnostic.
Every AI model can parse it natively. Every developer can read it in a
terminal, a browser, or a code review. There's no schema to learn, no
binary format to decode, no vendor lock-in. You can inspect your
context with `cat`, diff it with `git diff`, and review it in a PR.

## Does `ctx` Work Offline?

Yes. `ctx` is completely local. It reads and writes files on disk,
generates context packets from local state, and requires no network
access. The only feature that touches the network is the optional
[webhook notifications](../recipes/webhook-notifications.md) hook,
which you have to explicitly configure.

## What Gets Committed to Git?

The `.context/` directory: yes, commit it. That's the whole point.
Team members and AI agents read the same context files.

What **not** to commit:

- **`.ctx.key`**: your encryption key. Stored at `~/.ctx/.ctx.key`,
  never in the repo. `ctx init` handles this automatically.
- **`journal/`** and **`logs/`**: generated data, potentially large.
  `ctx init` adds these to `.gitignore`.
- **`scratchpad.enc`**: your choice. It's encrypted, so it's safe to
  commit if you want shared scratchpad state. See
  [Scratchpad](../reference/scratchpad.md) for details.

## How Big Should My Token Budget Be?

The default is 8000 tokens, which works well for most projects.
Configure it via `.ctxrc` or the `CTX_TOKEN_BUDGET` environment
variable:

```bash
# In .ctxrc
token_budget = 12000

# Or as an environment variable
export CTX_TOKEN_BUDGET=12000

# Or per-invocation
ctx agent --budget 4000
```

Higher budgets include more context but cost more tokens per request.
Lower budgets force sharper prioritization: `ctx` drops lower-priority
content first, so CONSTITUTION and TASKS always make the cut.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for all available settings.

## Why Not a Database?

Files are inspectable, diffable, and reviewable in pull requests.
You can `grep` them, `cat` them, pipe them through `jq` or `awk`.
They work with every version control system and every text editor.

A database would add a dependency, require migrations, and make
context opaque. The design bet is that context should be as visible
and portable as the code it describes.

## Does It Work with Tools Other than Claude Code?

Yes. `ctx agent` outputs a context packet that any AI tool can
consume: paste it into ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, or anything
else that accepts text input.

Claude Code gets first-class integration via the `ctx` plugin (hooks,
skills, automatic context loading). VS Code Copilot Chat has a
dedicated `ctx` extension. Other tools integrate via generated
instruction files or manual pasting.

See [Integrations](../operations/integrations.md) for tool-specific
setup, including the [multi-tool recipe](../recipes/multi-tool-setup.md).

## Can I Use `ctx` on an Existing Project?

Yes. Run `ctx init` in any repo and it creates `.context/` with
template files. Start recording decisions, tasks, and conventions as
you work. Context grows naturally; you don't need to backfill
everything on day one.

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for the full setup flow,
or [Joining a `ctx` Project](joining-a-project.md) if someone else
already initialized it.

## What Happens When Context Files Get Too Big?

Token budgeting handles this automatically. `ctx agent` prioritizes
content by file priority (CONSTITUTION first, GLOSSARY last) and
trims lower-priority entries when the budget is tight.

For manual maintenance, `ctx compact` archives completed tasks and
old entries, keeping active context lean. You can also run
`ctx task archive` to move completed tasks out of TASKS.md.

The goal is to keep context files focused on **current** state.
Historical entries belong in git history or the archive.

## Is `.context/` Meant to Be Shared?

Yes. Commit it to your repo. Every team member and every AI agent
reads the same files. That's the mechanism for shared memory:
decisions made in one session are visible in the next, regardless
of who (or what) starts it.

The only per-user state is the encryption key (`~/.ctx/.ctx.key`)
and the optional scratchpad. Everything else is team-shared by
design.
