## The Problem

Claude Code's `.claude/settings.local.json` accumulates one-off permissions
every time you click "*Allow*". After busy sessions the file is full of
session-specific entries that expand the agent's surface area beyond intent.

Since `settings.local.json` is `.gitignore`d, there is no PR review or CI
check. The file drifts independently on every machine, and there is no
built-in way to reset to a known-good state.

## TL;DR

```bash
/ctx-permission-sanitize               # audit for dangerous patterns
ctx permission snapshot            # save golden image
# ... sessions accumulate cruft ...
ctx permission restore             # reset to golden state
```

!!! warning "Activate the Project First"
    Run `eval "$(ctx activate)"` once per terminal in the project
    root. If you skip it, `ctx permission ...` fails with
    `Error: no context directory specified`. See
    [Activating a Context Directory](activating-context.md).

## The Solution

Save a curated `settings.local.json` as a **golden image**, then restore
from it to drop session-accumulated permissions. The golden file
(`.claude/settings.golden.json`) is committed to version control and shared
with the team.

## Commands and Skills Used

| Command/Skill               | Role in this workflow                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ctx permission snapshot`   | Save settings.local.json as golden image         |
| `ctx permission restore`    | Reset settings.local.json from golden image      |
| `/ctx-permission-sanitize` | Audit for dangerous patterns before snapshotting |

## Step by Step

### 1. Curate Your Permissions

Start with a clean `settings.local.json`. Optionally run `/ctx-permission-sanitize`
to remove dangerous patterns first.

Review the file manually. Every entry should be there because **you** decided
it belongs, not because you clicked "*Allow*" once during debugging.

See the [Permission Hygiene](claude-code-permissions.md) recipe for
recommended defaults.

### 2. Take a Snapshot

```bash
ctx permission snapshot
# Saved golden image: .claude/settings.golden.json
```

This creates a byte-for-byte copy. No re-encoding, no indent changes.

### 3. Commit the Golden File

```bash
git add .claude/settings.golden.json
git commit -m "Add permission golden image"
```

The golden file is **not** gitignored (unlike `settings.local.json`). This
is intentional: it becomes a team-shared baseline.

### 4. Auto-Restore at the Session Start

Add this instruction to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## On Session Start

Run `ctx permission restore` to reset permissions to the golden image.
```

The agent will restore the golden image at the start of every session,
automatically dropping any permissions accumulated during previous sessions.

### 5. Update When Intentional Changes Are Made

When you add a new permanent permission (*not a one-off debugging entry*):

```bash
# Edit settings.local.json with the new permission
# Then update the golden image:
ctx permission snapshot
git add .claude/settings.golden.json
git commit -m "Update permission golden image: add cargo test"
```

## Conversational Approach

You don't need to remember exact commands. These natural-language prompts
work with agents trained on the `ctx` playbook:

| What you say                              | What happens                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| "Save my current permissions as baseline" | Agent runs `ctx permission snapshot`                 |
| "Reset permissions to the golden image"   | Agent runs `ctx permission restore`                  |
| "Clean up my permissions"                 | Agent runs `/ctx-permission-sanitize` then snapshot |
| "What permissions did I accumulate?"      | Agent diffs local vs golden                          |
