# Personal Cross-Project Brain

This recipe shows **how one developer uses a `ctx` Hub
across their own projects day-to-day**, the "Story 1"
shape from the [Hub overview](hub-overview.md). You're not
setting up infrastructure for a team; you're making a
lesson you learned last Tuesday in project A automatically
surface when you open project B next Thursday.

**Prerequisites**: a working `ctx` Hub on localhost
(see [Getting Started](hub-getting-started.md) for the
roughly five-minute setup). This recipe assumes the hub is already
running and you've registered at least two projects.

!!! warning "Activate Each Project First"
    Run `eval "$(ctx activate)"` after each `cd <project>` (or wire
    it into direnv). The hub server (`ctx hub start`, etc.) runs on
    the server and doesn't need this; the commands in this recipe
    (`ctx add --share`, `ctx agent --include-hub`,
    `ctx connection ...`) live inside a project and do. If you
    skip the `eval`, they'll fail with `Error: no context directory
    specified`. See
    [Activating a Context Directory](activating-context.md).

## The Core Loop

Every day, the same three verbs matter:

1. **Record**: notice a decision, learning, or
   convention and capture it with `ctx add --share`.
2. **Subscribe**: every project you care about is
   subscribed to the types you want delivered (set once
   with `ctx connection subscribe`).
3. **Load**: your agent picks up shared entries on next
   session start via the auto-sync hook, or explicitly
   via `ctx agent --include-hub`.

That's the whole workflow. The rest of this recipe fills
in the concrete moments where each verb matters.

## A Realistic Day

You have three projects on your workstation:

- `~/projects/api`, a Go service you're actively
  developing
- `~/projects/cli`, a companion CLI that consumes the
  API
- `~/projects/dotfiles`, your personal conventions and
  cross-project learnings

All three are registered with a single hub running on
`localhost:9900` (started once at boot, or via a systemd
user unit; see [Hub operations](../operations/hub.md)).
All three subscribe to `decision`, `learning`, and
`convention`.

### 09:00 - Start Work on `api`

You `cd ~/projects/api` and start a Claude Code session.
Behind the scenes, the plugin's `PreToolUse` hook calls
`ctx agent --budget 8000 --include-hub` before the first
tool call. Agent loads:

- Local `.context/` (TASKS, DECISIONS, LEARNINGS, etc.)
- Foundation steering files (always-inclusion)
- **Everything you've shared from the other two projects**

So the "use UTC timestamps everywhere" decision you
recorded in `dotfiles` last week is already in Claude's
context for this session, without any manual `sync`.

### 10:30 - You Discover a Gotcha

While debugging, you find that the API's retry loop
silently drops the last error when the transport times
out. This is the kind of thing you'd normally add to
`LEARNINGS.md` in `api/`. But it's useful across every
Go service you'll ever write, not just this one. So:

```bash
ctx learning add --share \
  --context "Go http.Client retries mask the final error" \
  --lesson  "Transport timeouts don't surface as errors when the retry loop re-assigns err without wrapping. Check for context.DeadlineExceeded on the request context instead." \
  --application "Any retry loop over http.Client.Do that uses a per-attempt timeout"
```

The `--share` flag does two things:

1. Writes the learning to `api/.context/LEARNINGS.md`
   locally (as a normal `ctx learning add` would).
2. Publishes the same entry to the `ctx` Hub, which stores it
   in the append-only JSONL and fans it out to every
   subscribed client.

Within seconds, `cli/.context/hub/learnings.md` and
`dotfiles/.context/hub/learnings.md` both contain a copy
of this learning (the `ctx connection listen` daemon picks
it up from the `ctx` Hub's Listen stream).

### 12:00 - You Switch to `cli`

`cd ~/projects/cli`, open a new session. The agent
packet for `cli` now includes **the learning you just
recorded in `api`**, because `cli` is subscribed to
`learning` and the entry has already been synced into
`cli/.context/hub/learnings.md`.

You don't have to re-explain the retry-loop gotcha.
Claude already sees it.

### 14:00 - You Codify a Convention

You've been writing error messages in `api` and decided
you want a consistent pattern: lowercase start, no
trailing period, single-sentence. This is a convention,
not a decision; it applies to every Go project you
touch. Record it in `dotfiles` (since that's your
"personal standards" project), and share it:

```bash
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
ctx convention add --share \
  "Error messages: lowercase start, no trailing period, single sentence (follows Go's stdlib style)"
```

The convention lands in `dotfiles/CONVENTIONS.md` locally
and fans out to `api` and `cli` via the hub. The next
Claude Code session in either project gets the
convention injected into the steering-adjacent slot of
the agent packet.

### 16:30 - End of Day

You didn't run `ctx connection sync` once. You didn't
`git push` anything between projects. You didn't
remember to tell your agent about the retry-loop gotcha
in the new project. The hub did all of it for you.

## What the Workflow Actually Looks Like

Stripped of prose, the day's commands were:

```bash
# Morning: nothing. Agent loads --include-hub automatically.

# Mid-morning: record a learning that should cross projects
ctx learning add --share \
  --context "..." --lesson "..." --application "..."

# Afternoon: codify a convention in the "standards" project
ctx convention add --share "..."

# Evening: nothing. Everything's already propagated.
```

The hub is passive infrastructure. You never talk **to**
it directly; you talk **through** it by using `--share`
on commands you were already running.

## Tips for Solo Use

**Pick a "standards" project.** One of your projects
should play the role of "canonical source for rules you
want everywhere." Your dotfiles, a personal scratch
repo, or a dedicated `ctx-standards` project all work.
Record cross-cutting conventions there and let the hub
propagate them to everything else.

**Subscribe to `task` only if you want cross-project
todos.** The four subscribable types are `decision`,
`learning`, `convention`, `task`. Tasks are usually
project-local; subscribing makes every hub-shared task
from every project show up in every other project's
agent packet. That's probably not what you want. Skip
`task` in `ctx connection subscribe` unless you have a
specific reason.

**Run the hub as a user-level daemon** so you don't have
to remember to start it. On Linux with systemd:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/ctx-hub.service
[Unit]
Description=ctx Hub (personal)

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ctx hub start
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now ctx-hub.service
```

**Don't overthink subscription filters.** For personal
use, subscribe every project to all four types at first
(or three, if you skip `task`). Tune later if the
context packets get noisy.

**Local storage is fine; no TLS needed.** The hub runs
on localhost. No one else is on the network. Skip the
TLS setup from the
[Multi-machine recipe](hub-multi-machine.md); it's
relevant when the hub is on a LAN host serving multiple
workstations, not when it's a personal daemon.

## What This Recipe Is *Not*

**Not a setup guide.** For the one-time hub install and
project registration, use
[Getting Started](hub-getting-started.md).

**Not a team guide.** If you're sharing across humans,
not just across your own projects, read
[Team knowledge bus](hub-team.md) instead; the trust
model and operational concerns are different.

**Not production operations.** For backup, log
rotation, failure recovery, and HA, see
[Hub operations](../operations/hub.md) and
[Hub failure modes](../operations/hub-failure-modes.md).
