## The Problem

Something isn't working: a hook isn't firing, nudges are too noisy,
context seems stale, or the agent isn't following instructions. The
information to diagnose it exists (*across status, drift, event logs,
hook config, and session history*), but assembling it manually is tedious.

**How do you figure out what's wrong and fix it?**

## TL;DR

```bash
ctx doctor                   # structural health check
ctx hook event --last 20  # recent hook activity
# or ask: "something seems off, can you diagnose?"
```

## The Workflow

### Quick Check: `ctx doctor`

Run `ctx doctor` for an instant structural health report. It checks context
initialization, required files, drift, hook configuration, event logging,
webhooks, reminders, task completion ratio, and context token size: all in
one pass:

```bash
ctx doctor
```

```
ctx doctor
==========

Structure
  ✓ Context initialized (.context/)
  ✓ Required files present (4/4)

Quality
  ⚠ Drift: 2 warnings (stale path in ARCHITECTURE.md, high entry count in LEARNINGS.md)

Hooks
  ✓ hooks.json valid (14 hooks registered)
  ○ Event logging disabled (enable with event_log: true in .ctxrc)

State
  ✓ No pending reminders
  ⚠ Task completion ratio high (18/22 = 82%): consider archiving

Size
  ✓ Context size: ~4200 tokens (budget: 8000)

Summary: 2 warnings, 0 errors
```

Warnings are non-critical but worth fixing. Errors need attention.
Informational notes (○) flag optional features that aren't enabled.

For scripting:

```bash
ctx doctor --json | jq '.warnings'
```

### Deep Dive: `/ctx-doctor`

When you need the agent to reason about what's wrong, use the skill.
Ask naturally or invoke directly:

```text
Why didn't my hook fire?
Something seems off, can you diagnose?
/ctx-doctor
```

The agent follows a triage sequence:

1. **Baseline**: runs `ctx doctor --json` for structural health
2. **Events**: runs `ctx hook event --json --last 100` (if event logging enabled)
3. **Correlate**: connects findings across both sources
4. **Present**: structured findings with evidence
5. **Suggest**: actionable next steps (but doesn't auto-fix)

The skill degrades gracefully: without event logging enabled, it still runs
structural checks and notes what you'd gain by enabling it.

### Raw Event Inspection

For power users: `ctx hook event` with filters gives direct access to the
event log.

```bash
# Last 50 events (default)
ctx hook event

# Events from a specific session
ctx hook event --session eb1dc9cd-0163-4853-89d0-785fbfaae3a6

# Only QA reminder events
ctx hook event --hook qa-reminder

# Raw JSONL for jq processing
ctx hook event --json | jq '.message'

# Include rotated (older) events
ctx hook event --all --last 100
```

Filters use AND logic: `--hook qa-reminder --session abc123` returns only
QA reminder events from that specific session.

## Common Problems

### "No context directory specified for this project"

**Symptoms**: Any `ctx` command fails with
`Error: no context directory specified for this project` (*possibly
with a likely-candidate hint or a candidate list depending on what's
visible from your CWD*).

**Cause**: `ctx` does not search the filesystem for a `.context/`
directory. You have to declare which one to use before running
day-to-day commands.

**Fix**: bind `CTX_DIR` for the current shell:

```bash
eval "$(ctx activate)"
```

See [Activating a Context Directory](activating-context.md) for the
full recipe (one-shot `CTX_DIR=...` inline form, CI patterns, direnv
setup).

### "`ctx`: Not Initialized"

**Symptoms**: After declaring `CTX_DIR`, the command fails with
`ctx: not initialized - run "ctx init" first`.

**Cause**: The declared directory exists but hasn't been initialized
with template files.

**Fix**:

```bash
ctx init          # create .context/ with template files
ctx init --minimal  # or just the essentials (CONSTITUTION, TASKS, DECISIONS)
```

**Commands that work without CTX_DIR or initialization**: `ctx init`,
`ctx activate`, `ctx deactivate`, `ctx setup`, `ctx doctor`,
`ctx guide`, `ctx why`, `ctx config switch/status`, `ctx hub *`, and
help-only grouping commands.

### "My CLI and My Claude Code Session Disagree on the Project"

**Symptoms**: A `!`-pragma or interactive `ctx` call writes to the
wrong `.context/`; or you ran `ctx remind add` in shell A and the
reminder shows up in project B's notifications.

**Cause**: `CTX_DIR` is sourced from three different surfaces, and
they can drift apart:

| Surface                            | Source of `CTX_DIR`                         | Bound when                              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Claude Code hooks                  | `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.context` (injected) | Every hook line; the project Claude is in |
| `!`-pragma in chat / interactive shell | Whatever the parent shell exported      | When you ran `eval "$(ctx activate)"`   |
| New shell tab opened mid-session   | Whatever your shellrc exports               | Login                                   |

When these drift, the per-prompt `check-anchor-drift` hook fires a
verbatim warning naming both values. To fix: re-run
`eval "$(ctx activate)"` from inside the project the Claude Code
session is editing, or close the shell tab and reopen it from the
right working directory.

### "My Hook Isn't Firing"

**Symptoms**: No nudges appearing, webhook silent, event log shows no entries
for the expected hook.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# 1. Check if ctx is installed and on PATH
which ctx && ctx --version

# 2. Check if the hook is registered
grep "check-persistence" ~/.claude/plugins/ctx/hooks.json

# 3. Run the hook manually to see if it errors
echo '{"session_id":"test"}' | ctx system check-persistence

# 4. Check event log for the hook (if enabled)
ctx hook event --hook check-persistence
```

**Common causes**:

* **Plugin is not installed**: run `ctx init --claude` to reinstall
* **PATH issue**: the hook invokes `ctx` from PATH; ensure it resolves
* **Throttle active**: most hooks fire once per day: check
  `.context/state/` for daily marker files
* **Hook silenced**: a custom message override may be an empty file:
  check `ctx hook message list` for overrides

### "*Too Many Nudges*"

**Symptoms**: The agent is overwhelmed with hook output. Context checkpoints,
persistence reminders, and QA gates fire constantly.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check how often hooks fired recently
ctx hook event --last 50

# Count fires per hook
ctx hook event --json | jq -r '.detail.hook // "unknown"' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**Common causes**:

* **QA reminder is noisy by design**: it fires on every `Edit` call with no
  throttle. This is intentional. If it's too much, silence it with an empty
  override: `ctx hook message edit qa-reminder gate`, then empty the file
* **Long session**: context checkpoint fires with increasing frequency after
  prompt 15. This is the system telling you the session is getting long:
  consider wrapping up
* **Short throttle window**: if you deleted marker files in
  `.context/state/`, daily-throttled hooks will re-fire
* **Outdated Claude Code plugin**: Update the plugin using Claude Code --> 
  `/plugin` --> "Marketplace"
* **`ctx` version mismatch**: Build (*or download*) and install the 
  latest `ctx` vesion.

### "*Context Seems Stale*"

**Symptoms**: The agent references outdated information, paths that don't
exist, or decisions that were reversed.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Structural drift check
ctx drift

# Full doctor check (includes drift + more)
ctx doctor

# Check when context files were last modified
ctx status --verbose
```

**Common causes**:

* **Drift accumulated**: stale path references in `ARCHITECTURE.md` or
  `CONVENTIONS.md`. Fix with `ctx drift --fix` or ask the agent to clean up.
* **Task backlog**: too many completed tasks diluting active context. Archive
  with `ctx task archive` or `ctx compact --archive`.
* **Large context files**: `LEARNINGS.md` with 40+ entries competes for
  attention. Consolidate with `/ctx-consolidate`.
* **Missing session ceremonies**: if `/ctx-remember` and `/ctx-wrap-up` aren't
  being used, context doesn't get refreshed. See
  [Session Ceremonies](session-ceremonies.md).

### "*The Agent Isn't Following Instructions*"

**Symptoms**: The agent ignores conventions, forgets decisions, or acts
contrary to `CONSTITUTION.md` rules.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check context token size: Is it too large for the model?
ctx doctor --json | jq '.results[] | select(.name == "context_size")'

# Check if context is actually being loaded
ctx hook event --hook context-load-gate

```

**Common causes**:

* **Context too large**: if total tokens exceed the model's effective attention,
  instructions get diluted. Check `ctx doctor` for the size check. Compact with
  `ctx compact --archive`.
* **Context not loading**: if `context-load-gate` hasn't fired, the agent
  may not have received context. Verify the hook is registered.
* **Conflicting instructions**: `CONVENTIONS.md` says one thing,
  `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` says another. Review both files for consistency.
* **Agent drift**: the agent's behavior diverges from instructions over long
  sessions. This is normal. Use `/ctx-reflect` to re-anchor, or start a new
  session.

---

## Prerequisites

* **Event logging** (*optional but recommended*): `event_log: true` in `.ctxrc`
* **`ctx` initialized**: `ctx init`

Event logging is not required for `ctx doctor` or `/ctx-doctor` to work. Both
degrade gracefully: structural checks run regardless, and the skill notes when
event data is unavailable.

---

## Tips

* **Start with `ctx doctor`**: It's the fastest way to get a comprehensive
  health picture. Save event log inspection for when you need to understand
  *when* and *how often* something happened.
* **Enable event logging early**: The log is opt-in and low-cost (*~250 bytes
  per event, 1MB rotation cap*). Enable it before you need it: Diagnosing
  a problem without historical data is much harder.
* **Use the skill for correlation**: `ctx doctor` tells you *what* is wrong.
  `/ctx-doctor` tells you *why* by correlating structural findings with event
  patterns. The agent can spot connections that individual commands miss.
* **Event log is gitignored**: It's machine-local diagnostic data, not project
  context. Different machines produce different event streams.
