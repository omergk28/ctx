## The Problem

Your agent runs autonomously (*loops, implements, releases*) while you are away
from the terminal. You have no way to know when it finishes, hits a limit, or
when a hook fires a nudge.

**How do you get notified about agent activity without watching the terminal?**

## TL;DR

```bash
ctx hook notify setup  # configure webhook URL (encrypted)
ctx hook notify test   # verify delivery
# Hooks auto-notify on: session-end, loop-iteration, resource-danger
```

## Commands and Skills Used

| Tool                              | Type          | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ctx hook notify setup`                | CLI command   | Configure and encrypt webhook URL       |
| `ctx hook notify test`                 | CLI command   | Send a test notification                |
| `ctx hook notify --event <name> "msg"` | CLI command   | Send a notification from scripts/skills |
| `.ctxrc` `notify.events`          | Configuration | Filter which events reach your webhook  |

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Get a Webhook URL

Any service that accepts HTTP POST with JSON works. Common options:

| Service      | How to get a URL                                                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IFTTT**    | Create an applet with the "*Webhooks*" trigger                         |
| **Slack**    | Create an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) |
| **Discord**  | Channel Settings > Integrations > Webhooks                             |
| **ntfy.sh**  | Use `https://ntfy.sh/your-topic` (no signup)                           |
| **Pushover** | Use API endpoint with your user key                                    |

**The URL contains auth tokens**. `ctx` encrypts it; it never appears in plaintext
in your repo.

### Step 2: Configure the Webhook

```bash
ctx hook notify setup
# Enter webhook URL: https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/ctx/json/with/key/YOUR_KEY
# Webhook configured: https://maker.ifttt.com/***
# Encrypted at: .context/.notify.enc
```

This encrypts the URL with AES-256-GCM using the same key as the scratchpad
(`~/.ctx/.ctx.key`). The encrypted file (`.context/.notify.enc`)
is safe to commit. The key lives outside the project and is never committed.

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
ctx hook notify test
# Webhook responded: HTTP 200 OK
```

If you see `No webhook configured`, run `ctx hook notify setup` first.

### Step 4: Configure Events

Notifications are opt-in: no events are sent unless you configure an event
list in `.ctxrc`:

```yaml
# .ctxrc
notify:
  events:
    - loop       # loop completion or max-iteration hit
    - nudge      # VERBATIM relay hooks (context checkpoint, persistence, etc.)
    - relay      # all hook output (verbose, for debugging)
    - heartbeat  # every-prompt session-alive signal with metadata
```

Only listed events fire. Omitting an event silently drops it.

### Step 5: Use in Your Own Skills

Add `ctx hook notify` calls to any skill or script:

```bash
# In a release skill
ctx hook notify --event release "v1.2.0 released successfully" 2>/dev/null || true

# In a backup script
ctx hook notify --event backup "Nightly backup completed" 2>/dev/null || true
```

The `2>/dev/null || true` suffix ensures the notification never breaks your
script: If there's no webhook or the HTTP call fails, it's a silent noop.

## Event Types

`ctx` fires these events automatically:

| Event       | Source            | When                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `loop`      | Loop script       | Loop completes or hits max iterations                                                                                 |
| `nudge`     | System hooks      | VERBATIM relay nudge is emitted (context checkpoint, persistence, ceremonies, journal, resources, knowledge, version) |
| `relay`     | System hooks      | Any hook output (VERBATIM relays, agent directives, block responses)                                                  |
| `heartbeat` | System hook       | Every prompt: session-alive signal with prompt count and context modification status                                  |
| `test`      | `ctx hook notify test` | Manual test notification                                                                                              |
| *(custom)*  | Your skills       | You wire `ctx hook notify --event <name>` in your own scripts                                                              |

**`nudge` vs `relay`**: The `nudge` event fires only for VERBATIM relay hooks
(*the ones the agent is instructed to show verbatim*). The `relay` event fires
for *all* hook output: VERBATIM relays, agent directives, and hard gates.
Subscribe to `relay` for debugging (*"did the agent get the post-commit nudge?"*),
`nudge` for user-facing assurance (*"was the checkpoint emitted?"*).

!!! tip "Webhooks as a Hook Audit Trail"
    Subscribe to `relay` events and you get an external record of every
    hook that fires, independent of the agent. 

    This lets you verify hooks are running and catch cases where the agent 
    absorbs a nudge instead of surfacing it. 

    See [Auditing System Hooks](system-hooks-audit.md) for the full workflow.

## Payload Format

Every notification sends a JSON POST:

```json
{
  "event": "nudge",
  "message": "check-context-size: Context window at 82%",
  "detail": {
    "hook": "check-context-size",
    "variant": "window",
    "variables": {"Percentage": 82, "TokenCount": "164k"}
  },
  "session_id": "abc123-...",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-22T14:30:00Z",
  "project": "ctx"
}
```

The `detail` field is a structured template reference containing the hook
name, variant, and any template variables. This lets receivers filter by
hook or variant without parsing rendered text. The field is omitted when
no template reference applies (e.g. custom `ctx hook notify` calls).

### Heartbeat Payload

The `heartbeat` event fires on every prompt with session metadata and token
usage telemetry:

```json
{
  "event": "heartbeat",
  "message": "heartbeat: prompt #7 (context_modified=false tokens=158k pct=79%)",
  "detail": {
    "hook": "heartbeat",
    "variant": "pulse",
    "variables": {
      "prompt_count": 7,
      "session_id": "abc123-...",
      "context_modified": false,
      "tokens": 158000,
      "context_window": 200000,
      "usage_pct": 79
    }
  },
  "session_id": "abc123-...",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-28T10:15:00Z",
  "project": "ctx"
}
```

The `tokens`, `context_window`, and `usage_pct` fields are included when
token data is available from the session JSONL file. They are omitted when
no usage data has been recorded yet (e.g. first prompt).

Unlike other events, `heartbeat` fires every prompt (not throttled). Use it
for observability dashboards or liveness monitoring of long-running sessions.

## Security Model

| Component      | Location                          | Committed?      | Permissions |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Encryption key | `~/.ctx/.ctx.key`                 | No (user-level) | `0600`      |
| Encrypted URL  | `.context/.notify.enc`            | Yes (safe)      | `0600`      |
| Webhook URL    | Never on disk in plaintext        | N/A             | N/A         |

The key is shared with the scratchpad. If you rotate the encryption key,
re-run `ctx hook notify setup` to re-encrypt the webhook URL with the new key.

## Key Rotation

`ctx` checks the age of the encryption key once per day. If it's older
than 90 days (*configurable via `key_rotation_days`*), a VERBATIM nudge
is emitted suggesting rotation.

```yaml
# .ctxrc
key_rotation_days: 30   # nudge sooner (default: 90)
```

## Worktrees

The webhook URL is encrypted with the same encryption key
(`~/.ctx/.ctx.key`). Because the key lives at the user level, it is
shared across all worktrees on the same machine -
notifications work in worktrees automatically.

This means **agents running in worktrees cannot send webhook alerts**.
For autonomous runs where worktree agents are opaque, monitor them from
the terminal rather than relying on webhooks. Enrich journals and review
results on the main branch after merging.

## Event Log: The Local Complement

Don't need a webhook but want diagnostic visibility? Enable `event_log: true`
in `.ctxrc`. The event log writes the same payload as webhooks to a local
JSONL file (`.context/state/events.jsonl`) that you can query without any
external service:

```bash
ctx hook event --last 20          # recent hook activity
ctx hook event --hook qa-reminder # filter by hook
```

Webhooks and event logging are independent: you can use either, both, or
neither. Webhooks give you push notifications and an external audit trail.
The event log gives you local queryability and `ctx doctor` integration.

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for how they work together.

## Tips

* **Fire-and-forget**: Notifications never block. HTTP errors are silently
  ignored. No retry, no response parsing.
* **No webhook = no cost**: When no webhook is configured, `ctx hook notify` exits
  immediately. System hooks that call `notify.Send()` add zero overhead.
* **Multiple projects**: Each project has its own `.notify.enc`. You can point
  different projects at different webhooks.
* **Event filter is per-project**: Configure `notify.events` in each project's
  `.ctxrc` independently.
