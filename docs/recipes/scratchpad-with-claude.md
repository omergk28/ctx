## The Problem

During a session you accumulate quick notes, reminders, intermediate values,
and sometimes sensitive tokens. They don't fit `TASKS.md` (*not work items*) or
`DECISIONS.md` (*not decisions*). They don't have the structured fields that
`LEARNINGS.md` requires.

Without somewhere to put them, they get lost between sessions.

**How do you capture working memory that persists across sessions without
polluting your structured context files?**

## TL;DR

```bash
ctx pad add "check DNS propagation after deploy"
ctx pad         # list entries
ctx pad show 1  # print entry (pipe-friendly)
```

Entries are **encrypted at rest** and travel with `git`. 

Use the `/ctx-pad` skill to manage entries from inside your AI session.

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Add a Note Naturally

You don't need to remember any syntax. Just tell your assistant what to
jot down:

```text
You: "jot down: check DNS propagation after deploy"

Agent: "Added to scratchpad:
  1. check DNS propagation after deploy"
```

Behind the scenes, the agent runs `ctx pad add "check DNS propagation after deploy"`.

### Step 2: View Your Scratchpad

```text
You: "show my scratchpad"

Agent: "Your scratchpad has 3 entries:
  1. check DNS propagation after deploy
  2. staging API endpoint: api.staging.example.com/v2
  3. retry limit should be 5, not 3"
```

### Step 3: Edit an Entry

```text
You: "update entry 2 to include the new endpoint"

Agent: "Updated entry 2:
  was: staging API endpoint: api.staging.example.com/v2
  now: staging API endpoint: api.prod.example.com/v2"
```

For partial edits, the agent can use `--append` or `--prepend`:

```text
You: "append the port number to entry 2"

Agent: "Updated entry 2:
  staging API endpoint: api.prod.example.com/v2 :8443"
```

### Step 4: Compose Entries

Use `ctx pad show N` to pipe entry content into other operations:

```text
You: "append the content of entry 3 to entry 1"

Agent: [runs ctx pad edit 1 --append "$(ctx pad show 3)"]
       "Done. Entry 1 is now:
        check DNS propagation after deploy retry limit should be 5, not 3"
```

### Step 5: Reorder by Priority

```text
You: "move entry 4 to the top"

Agent: [runs ctx pad mv 4 1]
       "Moved entry 4 to position 1. Scratchpad reordered."
```

### Step 6: Clean Up

```text
You: "remove entry 2, it's done"

Agent: [runs ctx pad rm 2]
       "Removed entry 2. 3 entries remaining.
        (IDs are stable; remaining entries keep their IDs.)"
```

### Step 7: Store a File as a Blob

The scratchpad can hold small files (*up to 64 KB*) as encrypted blob entries.
The file is base64-encoded and stored alongside a label you provide:

```bash
# Ingest a file: the first argument is the label
ctx pad add "deploy config" --file ./deploy.yaml

# List shows the label with a [BLOB] marker
ctx pad
#   1. check DNS propagation after deploy
#   2. deploy config [BLOB]
```

### Step 8: Extract a Blob

Use `show --out` to write the decoded file back to disk:

```bash
# Write blob entry to a file
ctx pad show 2 --out ./recovered-deploy.yaml

# Or print to stdout (for piping)
ctx pad show 2 | head -5
```

Blob entries are encrypted identically to text entries: They're just
base64-encoded before encryption. The `--out` flag decodes and writes the
raw bytes.

### Step 9: Bulk Import Notes

When you have a file with many notes (*one per line*), import them in bulk
instead of adding one at a time:

```bash
# Import from a file: Each non-empty line becomes an entry
ctx pad import notes.txt

# Or pipe from stdin
grep TODO *.go | ctx pad import -
```

All entries are written in a single encrypt/write cycle, regardless of
how many lines the file contains.

### Step 10: Export Blobs to Disk

Export all blob entries to a directory as individual files. Each blob's
label becomes the filename:

```bash
# Export to a directory (created if needed)
ctx pad export ./ideas

# Preview what would be exported
ctx pad export --dry-run ./ideas

# Force overwrite existing files
ctx pad export --force ./backup
```

When a file already exists, a unix timestamp is prepended to the filename
to avoid collisions. Use `--force` to overwrite instead.

### Step 11: Tag Entries for Organization

Tags let you categorize entries without any structure beyond a `#word`
token in the text. Add them when creating or editing entries:

```text
You: "jot down: check DNS propagation #later"
You: "tag entry 2 as urgent"

Agent: [runs ctx pad edit 2 --tag urgent]
       "Updated entry 2."
```

Filter your scratchpad by tag:

```text
You: "show me everything tagged later"

Agent: [runs ctx pad --tag later]
       "  1. check DNS propagation #later
        3. review PR feedback #later #ci"
```

Entry IDs are stable; they don't shift when other entries are deleted,
so `ctx pad rm 3` always targets the same entry regardless of deletions
or active filters. Use `ctx pad normalize` to reassign IDs as 1..N.

Exclude a tag with `~`:

```bash
ctx pad --tag ~later         # everything NOT tagged #later
ctx pad --tag later --tag ci # entries with BOTH tags (AND logic)
```

See what tags you're using:

```text
You: "what tags do I have?"

Agent: [runs ctx pad tags]
       "ci       1
        later    2
        urgent   1"
```

Tags work on blob entries too; they're extracted from the label:

```bash
ctx pad add "deploy config #prod" --file ./deploy.yaml
ctx pad --tag prod
#   1. deploy config #prod [BLOB]
```

## Using `/ctx-pad` in a Session

Invoke the `/ctx-pad` skill first, then describe what you want in natural
language. Without the skill prefix, the agent may route your request to
`TASKS.md` or another context file instead of the scratchpad.

```text
You: /ctx-pad jot down: check DNS after deploy
You: /ctx-pad show my scratchpad
You: /ctx-pad delete entry 3
```

Once the skill is active, it translates intent into commands:

| You say (after `/ctx-pad`)                | What the agent does                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| "jot down: check DNS after deploy"        | `ctx pad add "check DNS after deploy"`  |
| "remember this: retry limit is 5"         | `ctx pad add "retry limit is 5"`        |
| "show my scratchpad" / "what's on my pad" | `ctx pad`                               |
| "show me entry 3"                         | `ctx pad show 3`                        |
| "delete the third one" / "remove entry 3" | `ctx pad rm 3`                          |
| "remove entries 3 through 5"              | `ctx pad rm 3-5`                        |
| "renumber my scratchpad"                  | `ctx pad normalize`                     |
| "change entry 2 to ..."                   | `ctx pad edit 2 "new text"`             |
| "append ' +important' to entry 3"         | `ctx pad edit 3 --append " +important"` |
| "prepend 'URGENT:' to entry 1"            | `ctx pad edit 1 --prepend "URGENT: "`   |
| "prioritize entry 4" / "move to the top"  | `ctx pad mv 4 1`                        |
| "import my notes from notes.txt"          | `ctx pad import notes.txt`              |
| "export all blobs to ./ideas"             | `ctx pad export ./ideas`                |
| "show entries tagged later"               | `ctx pad --tag later`                   |
| "show everything except later"            | `ctx pad --tag ~later`                  |
| "what tags do I have"                     | `ctx pad tags`                          |
| "tag entry 5 as urgent"                   | `ctx pad edit 5 --tag urgent`           |

!!! tip "When in Doubt, Use the CLI Directly"
    The `ctx pad` commands work the same whether you run them yourself
    or let the skill invoke them. 

    If the agent misroutes a request,
    fall back to `ctx pad add "..."` in your terminal.

## When to Use Scratchpad vs Context Files

| Situation                                                  | Use                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Temporary reminders ("*check X after deploy*")             | **Scratchpad**       |
| Session-start reminders ("*remind me next session*")       | **`ctx remind`**     |
| Working values during debugging (ports, endpoints, counts) | **Scratchpad**       |
| Sensitive tokens or API keys (short-term storage)          | **Scratchpad**       |
| Quick notes that don't fit anywhere else                   | **Scratchpad**       |
| Work items with completion tracking                        | **`TASKS.md`**       |
| Trade-offs between alternatives with rationale             | **`DECISIONS.md`**   |
| Reusable lessons with context/lesson/application           | **`LEARNINGS.md`**   |
| Codified patterns and standards                            | **`CONVENTIONS.md`** |

**Decision Guide**

* If it has structured fields (*context, rationale, lesson, application*),
  it belongs in a **context file** like `DECISIONS.md` or `LEARNINGS.md`.
* If it's a work item you'll mark done, it belongs in `TASKS.md`.
* If you want a message relayed VERBATIM at the next session start,
  it belongs in `ctx remind`.
* If it's a quick note, reminder, or working value (*especially if it's
  sensitive or ephemeral*) it belongs on the **scratchpad**.

!!! tip "Scratchpad Is Not a Junk Drawer"
    The scratchpad is for working memory, not long-term storage.

    If a note is still relevant after several sessions, promote it:

    A persistent reminder becomes a task, a recurring value becomes a
    convention, a hard-won insight becomes a learning.

## Tips

* **Entries persist across sessions**: The scratchpad is committed
  (encrypted) to git, so entries survive session boundaries. Pick up
  where you left off.
* **Entries are numbered and reorderable**: Use `ctx pad mv` to put
  high-priority items at the top.
* **`ctx pad show N` enables unix piping**: Output raw entry text
  with no numbering prefix. Compose with `--append`, `--prepend`, or
  other shell tools.
* **Never mention the key file contents to the AI**: The agent knows
  how to use `ctx pad` commands but should never read or print
  the encryption key (`~/.ctx/.ctx.key`) directly.
* **Encryption is transparent**: You interact with plaintext; the
  encryption/decryption happens automatically on every read/write.

## If You Delete the Wrong Thing

Every destructive `ctx pad` operation (add, edit, mv, rm, merge,
normalize, resolve, tag) writes a snapshot of the prior pad blob
to `.context/scratchpad.history/` *before* overwriting. There is
no confirmation prompt on the hot path — and you don't need one,
because `ctx pad undo` restores the most recent snapshot:

```bash
ctx pad rm 3        # oh no, that was the one with the API token
ctx pad undo        # → "Restored pad from snapshot 20260524..."
```

A few things to know:

* **Undo is itself snapshotted.** Running `ctx pad undo` twice
  in a row is a redo — the first undo saves the post-mutation
  state, then promotes the pre-mutation state; the second undo
  reverses that.
* **Empty history is not an error.** On a brand-new project
  with no mutations yet, `ctx pad undo` prints `No pad history
  to restore.` and exits 0.
* **Snapshots are encrypted with the same key as the live pad.**
  Losing `~/.ctx/.ctx.key` makes both unreadable; the safety
  net does not change the key-loss failure mode.
* **Retention is bounded.** The 20 most recent snapshots
  (capped also at 30 days) are kept; older ones are pruned
  after each mutation. Off-host backups remain the recovery
  path for anything beyond that window.
