![ctx](../images/ctx-banner.png)

## The Problem

You have installed `ctx` and want to set it up with your AI coding assistant so
that context persists across sessions. Different tools have different
integration depths. For example: 

* Claude Code supports native hooks that load and save context automatically.
* Cursor injects context via its system prompt.
* Aider reads context files through its `--read` flag.

This recipe walks through the complete setup for each tool, from initialization
through verification, so you end up with a working memory layer regardless of
which AI tool you use.

## TL;DR

```bash
cd your-project
ctx init                      # creates .context/
eval "$(ctx activate)"        # bind CTX_DIR for this shell
source <(ctx completion zsh)  # shell completion (or bash/fish)

# ## Claude Code (automatic after plugin install) ##
claude /plugin marketplace add ActiveMemory/ctx
claude /plugin install ctx@activememory-ctx

# ## OpenCode ##
ctx setup opencode --write && ctx init && eval "$(ctx activate)"

# ## Cursor / Aider / Copilot / Windsurf ##
ctx setup cursor # or: aider, copilot, windsurf

# ## Companion tools (highly recommended) ##
npx gitnexus analyze          # code knowledge graph
# Add Gemini Search MCP server for grounded web search
```

!!! warning "Activate the Project Once Per Shell"
    Run `eval "$(ctx activate)"` after `ctx init`. The `ctx setup`,
    `ctx init`, and `ctx completion` commands work without it, but
    if you skip the `eval`, most others (`ctx agent`, `ctx load`,
    `ctx watch`, `ctx journal ...`) fail with `Error: no context
    directory specified`. See
    [Activating a Context Directory](activating-context.md).

Create a [`.ctxrc`](../home/configuration.md) in your project root to configure
token budgets, context directory, drift thresholds, and more.

Then start your AI tool and ask: "**Do you remember?**"

## Commands and Skills Used

| Command/Skill       | Role in this workflow                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ctx init`          | Create `.context/` directory, templates, and permissions     |
| `ctx setup`          | Generate integration configuration for a specific AI tool    |
| `ctx agent`         | Print a token-budgeted context packet for AI consumption     |
| `ctx load`          | Output assembled context in read order (for manual pasting)  |
| `ctx watch`         | Auto-apply context updates from AI output (non-native tools) |
| `ctx completion`    | Generate shell autocompletion for bash, zsh, or fish         |
| `ctx journal import` | Import sessions to editable journal Markdown                 |

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Initialize `ctx`

Run `ctx init` in your project root. This creates the `.context/` directory
with all template files and seeds `ctx` permissions in `settings.local.json`.

```bash
cd your-project
ctx init
```

This produces the following structure:

```
.context/
  CONSTITUTION.md     # Hard rules the AI must never violate
  TASKS.md            # Current and planned work
  CONVENTIONS.md      # Code patterns and standards
  ARCHITECTURE.md     # System overview
  DECISIONS.md        # Architectural decisions with rationale
  LEARNINGS.md        # Lessons learned, gotchas, tips
  GLOSSARY.md         # Domain terms and abbreviations
  AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md   # How AI tools should use this system
```

!!! note "Using a Different `.context` Directory"
    The `.context/` directory doesn't have to live inside your project. Point
    `ctx` to an external folder by exporting `CTX_DIR` (the only
    declaration channel).

    Useful when context must stay private while the code is public, or
    when you want to commit notes to a separate repo.

    **Caveats** (the recipe covers both with workarounds):

    * **Code-aware operations degrade silently.** `ctx sync`, `ctx drift`,
      and the memory-drift hook read the codebase from
      `dirname(CTX_DIR)`. With an external `.context/`, that's the
      context repo, not your code repo. They scan the wrong tree without
      erroring. The recipe shows a symlink workaround that keeps both
      healthy.
    * **One `.context/` per project, always.** Sharing one directory
      across multiple projects corrupts journals, state, and secrets.
      For cross-project knowledge sharing (CONSTITUTION, CONVENTIONS,
      ARCHITECTURE, etc.) use [`ctx hub`](hub-overview.md), not a
      shared `.context/`.

    See [External Context](external-context.md) for the full recipe
    and [Configuration](../home/configuration.md#environment-variables)
    for the resolver details.

For Claude Code, install the **`ctx` plugin** to get hooks and skills:

```bash
claude /plugin marketplace add ActiveMemory/ctx
claude /plugin install ctx@activememory-ctx
```

If you only need the core files (*useful for lightweight setups*),
use the `--minimal` flag:

```bash
ctx init --minimal
```

This creates only `TASKS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `CONSTITUTION.md`.

### Step 2: Generate Tool-Specific Hooks

If you are using a tool other than Claude Code (*which is configured
automatically by `ctx init`*), generate its integration configuration:

```bash
# For Cursor
ctx setup cursor

# For Aider
ctx setup aider

# For GitHub Copilot
ctx setup copilot

# For Windsurf
ctx setup windsurf
```

Each command prints the configuration you need. How you apply it depends on the
tool.

#### Claude Code

No action needed. Just install `ctx` from the Marketplace
as `ActiveMemory/ctx`.

!!! tip "Claude Code Is a First-Class Citizen"
    With the `ctx` plugin installed, Claude Code gets hooks and skills
    automatically. The `PreToolUse` hook runs
    `ctx agent --budget 4000` on every tool call
    (*with a 10-minute cooldown so it only fires once per window*).

#### OpenCode

Run the one-liner from the project root:

```bash
ctx setup opencode --write && ctx init && eval "$(ctx activate)"
```

This deploys a lifecycle plugin, slash command skills, `AGENTS.md`, and
registers the `ctx` MCP server globally. See
[`ctx` for OpenCode](../home/opencode.md) for full details.

!!! tip "OpenCode Is a First-Class Citizen"
    With the plugin installed, OpenCode gets lifecycle hooks and skills
    automatically. Context loads at session start, survives compaction,
    and persists at session end — no manual steps needed.

#### VS Code

Install the **`ctx`** extension from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=activememory.ctx-context)
(publisher: `activememory`). Then, from your project root:

```bash
ctx init && eval "$(ctx activate)"
```

Open Copilot Chat and type `@ctx /init` to verify. The extension
auto-downloads the `ctx` CLI if it isn't on PATH. See
[`ctx` for VS Code](../home/vscode.md) for full details.

!!! tip "VS Code Is a First-Class Citizen"
    The extension carries its own runtime. No `ctx setup` step is
    needed. It registers a `@ctx` chat participant with 45 slash
    commands, automatic hooks (file save, git commit, `.context/`
    change, dependency-file edit), and a reminder status-bar
    indicator. Unlike embedded harnesses, the extension ships
    through its own pipeline to the VS Code Marketplace.

#### Cursor

Add the system prompt snippet to `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ai.systemPrompt": "Read .context/TASKS.md and .context/CONVENTIONS.md before responding. Follow rules in .context/CONSTITUTION.md."
}
```

Context files appear in Cursor's file tree. You can also paste a context packet
directly into chat:

```bash
ctx agent --budget 4000 | xclip    # Linux
ctx agent --budget 4000 | pbcopy   # macOS
```

#### Aider

Create `.aider.conf.yml` so context files are loaded on every
session:

```yaml
read:
  - .context/CONSTITUTION.md
  - .context/TASKS.md
  - .context/CONVENTIONS.md
  - .context/DECISIONS.md
```

Then start Aider normally:

```bash
aider
```

Or specify files on the command line:

```bash
aider --read .context/TASKS.md --read .context/CONVENTIONS.md
```

### Step 3: Set Up Shell Completion

Shell completion lets you tab-complete `ctx` subcommands and flags, which is
especially useful while learning the CLI.

```bash
# Bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
source <(ctx completion bash)

# Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
source <(ctx completion zsh)

# Fish
ctx completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ctx.fish
```

After sourcing, typing `ctx a<TAB>` completes to `ctx agent`, and
`ctx journal <TAB>` shows `list`, `show`, and `export`.

### Step 4: Verify the Setup Works

Start a fresh session in your AI tool and ask:

**"Do you remember?"**


A correctly configured tool responds with specific context: current tasks from
`TASKS.md`, recent decisions, and previous session topics. It should **not** say
"*I don't have memory*" or "*Let me search for files.*"

This question checks the *passive* side of memory. A properly set-up agent is
also **proactive**: it treats context maintenance as part of its job:

* After a debugging session, it offers to save a **learning**.
* After a trade-off discussion, it asks whether to record the **decision**.
* After completing a task, it suggests **follow-up items**.

The "**do you remember?**" check verifies both halves: recall **and**
responsibility.

For example, after resolving a tricky bug, a proactive agent might say:

```text
That Redis timeout issue was subtle. Want me to save this as a *learning*
so we don't hit it again?
```

If you see behavior like this, the setup is working end to end.

In Claude Code, you can also invoke the `/ctx-status` skill:

```text
/ctx-status
```

This prints a summary of all context files, token counts, and recent activity,
confirming that hooks are loading context.

If context is not loading, check the basics:

| Symptom                         | Fix                                                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ctx: command not found`        | Ensure `ctx` is in your PATH: `which ctx`                       |
| Hook errors                     | Verify plugin is installed: `claude /plugin list`             |
| Context not refreshing          | Cooldown may be active; wait 10 minutes or set `--cooldown 0` |

### Step 5: Enable Watch Mode for Non-Native Tools

Tools like Aider, Copilot, and Windsurf do not support native hooks for saving
context automatically. For these, run `ctx watch` alongside your AI tool.

Pipe the AI tool's output through `ctx watch`:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run Aider with output logged
aider 2>&1 | tee /tmp/aider.log

# Terminal 2: Watch the log for context updates
ctx watch --log /tmp/aider.log
```

Or for any generic tool:

```bash
your-ai-tool 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ai.log &
ctx watch --log /tmp/ai.log
```

When the AI emits structured update commands, `ctx watch` parses and applies
them automatically:

```xml
<context-update type="learning"
  context="Debugging rate limiter"
  lesson="Redis MULTI/EXEC does not roll back on error"
  application="Wrap rate-limit checks in Lua scripts instead"
>Redis Transaction Behavior</context-update>
```

To preview changes without modifying files:

```bash
ctx watch --dry-run --log /tmp/ai.log
```

### Step 6: Import Session Transcripts (*Optional*)

If you want to browse past session transcripts, import them to the journal:

```bash
ctx journal import --all
```

This converts raw session data into editable Markdown files in
`.context/journal/`. You can then enrich them with metadata using
`/ctx-journal-enrich-all` inside your AI assistant.

## Putting It All Together

Here is the condensed setup for all three tools:

```bash
# ## Common (run once per project) ##
cd your-project
ctx init
source <(ctx completion zsh)       # or bash/fish

# ## Claude Code (automatic, just verify) ##
# Start Claude Code, then ask: "Do you remember?"

# ## OpenCode ##
ctx setup opencode --write
# Start OpenCode, then ask: "Do you remember?"

# ## Cursor ##
ctx setup cursor
# Add the system prompt to .cursor/settings.json
# Paste context: ctx agent --budget 4000 | pbcopy

# ## Aider ##
ctx setup aider
# Create .aider.conf.yml with read: paths
# Run watch mode alongside: ctx watch --log /tmp/aider.log

# ## Verify any Tool ##
# Ask your AI: "Do you remember?"
# Expect: specific tasks, decisions, recent context
```

## Tips

* Start with `ctx init` (not `--minimal`) for your first project. The full
  template set gives the agent more to work with, and you can always delete
  files later.
* For Claude Code, the token budget is configured in the plugin's `hooks.json`.
  To customize, adjust the `--budget` flag in the `ctx agent` hook command.
* The `--session $PPID` flag isolates cooldowns per Claude Code process, so
  parallel sessions do not suppress each other.
* Commit your `.context/` directory to version control. Several `ctx` features
  (journals, changelogs, blog generation) rely on git history.
* For Cursor and Copilot, keep `CONVENTIONS.md` visible. These tools treat
  open files as higher-priority context.
* Run `ctx drift` periodically to catch stale references before they confuse
  the agent.
* The agent playbook instructs the agent to persist context at **natural
  milestones** (*completed tasks, decisions, gotchas*). In practice, this
  works best when you reinforce the habit: a quick "*anything worth saving?*"
  after a debugging session goes a long way.

## Companion Tools (Highly Recommended)

`ctx` skills can leverage external MCP servers for web search and code
intelligence. `ctx` works without them, but they significantly improve
agent behavior across sessions. The investment is small and the
benefits compound. Skills like `/ctx-code-review`, `/ctx-explain`,
and `/ctx-refactor` all become noticeably better with these tools
connected.

### Gemini Search

Provides grounded web search with citations. Used by skills and the
agent playbook as the preferred search backend (faster and more accurate
than built-in web search).

**Setup**: Add the Gemini Search MCP server to your Claude Code settings.
See the [Gemini Search MCP documentation](https://github.com/nicobailon/gemini-code-search-mcp)
for installation.

**Verification**:
```bash
# The agent checks this automatically during /ctx-remember
# Manual test: ask the agent to search for something
```

### GitNexus

Provides a code knowledge graph with symbol resolution, blast radius
analysis, and domain clustering. Used by skills like `/ctx-refactor`
(impact analysis) and `/ctx-code-review` (dependency awareness).

**Setup**: Add the GitNexus MCP server to your Claude Code settings,
then index your project:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# The agent checks this automatically during /ctx-remember
# If the index is stale, it will suggest rehydrating
```

### Suppressing the Check

If you don't use companion tools and want to skip the availability
check at session start, add to `.ctxrc`:

```yaml
companion_check: false
```

### Future Direction

The companion tool integration is evolving toward a pluggable model:
bring your own search engine, bring your own code intelligence. The
current integration is MCP-based and limited to Gemini Search and
GitNexus. If you use a different search or code intelligence tool,
skills will degrade gracefully to built-in capabilities.
