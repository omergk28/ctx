## High-Level Mental Model

Many tools help AI *think*.

`ctx` helps AI *remember*.

* **Not** by storing thoughts,
* **but** by preserving intent.

## How `ctx` Differs from Similar Tools

There are many tools in the AI ecosystem that touch *parts* of the context
problem:

* Some manage prompts.  
* Some retrieve data.  
* Some provide runtime context objects.  
* Some offer enterprise platforms.

`ctx` focuses on a different layer entirely.

This page explains where `ctx` fits, and where it **intentionally** does not.

---

## The Core Distinction

Most tools treat context as **input**.

`ctx` treats context as **infrastructure**.

That single difference explains nearly all of `ctx`'s design choices.

| Question                 | Most tools                | `ctx`              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Where does context live? | In prompts or APIs        | In files         |
| How long does it last?   | One request / one session | Across time      |
| Who can read it?         | The model                 | Humans and tools |
| How is it updated?       | Implicitly                | Explicitly       |
| Is it inspectable?       | Rarely                    | Always           |

## Prompt Management Tools

Examples include:

* prompt templates;
* reusable system prompts;
* prompt libraries;
* prompt versioning tools.

These tools help you *start* a session.

They do not help you *continue* one.

Prompt tools:

* inject text at session start;
* are ephemeral by design;
* do not evolve with the project.

`ctx`:

* **persists knowledge** over time;
* accumulates **decisions** and **learnings**;
* makes the **context** part of the repository itself.

Prompt tooling and `ctx` are **complementary**; not competing. 
Yet, they operate in different layers.

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG systems typically:

* index documents
* embed text
* retrieve chunks dynamically at runtime

They are excellent for:

* large knowledge bases
* static documentation
* reference material

RAG answers questions like:

> "What information might be relevant right now?"

`ctx` answers a different question:

> "What have we already decided, learned, or committed to?"

Here are some key differences:

| RAG                   | `ctx`                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Statistical relevance | Intentional relevance |
| Embedding-based       | File-based            |
| Opaque retrieval      | Explicit structure    |
| Runtime query         | Persistent memory     |

`ctx` does not replace RAG.
Instead, it defines a persistent context layer that RAG can optionally augment.

> RAG belongs to the **data plane**; `ctx` defines the **context control plane**.

It focuses on **project memory**, not knowledge search.

---

## Agent Frameworks

Agent frameworks often provide:

* task loops
* tool orchestration
* planner/executor patterns
* autonomous iteration

These systems are powerful, but they typically assume that:

* memory is external
* context is injected
* state is transient

Agent frameworks answer:

> "How should the agent act?"

`ctx` answers:

> "What should the agent remember?"

Without persistent context, agents tend to:

* rediscover decisions
* repeat mistakes
* lose architectural intent

This is why `ctx` pairs well with [autonomous loop workflows](../operations/autonomous-loop.md):

* The loop provides iteration
* `ctx` provides continuity

Together, loops become cumulative instead of forgetful.

---

## SDK-Level Context Objects

Some SDKs expose "*context*" objects that exist:

* inside a process
* during a request
* for the lifetime of a call chain

These are extremely useful and completely different.

SDK context objects:

* are in-memory
* disappear when the process ends
* are not shared across sessions

`ctx`:

* survives process restarts
* survives new chats
* survives new days

They share a name, not a purpose.

---

## Enterprise Context Platforms

Enterprise platforms often provide:

* centralized context services
* dashboards
* access control
* organizational knowledge layers

These tools are designed for:

* teams
* governance
* compliance
* managed environments

`ctx` is intentionally:

* **local-first**: context lives next to your code, not
  behind a service boundary.
* **file-based**: everything important is a markdown
  file you can read, diff, grep, and version-control.
* **single-binary core**: the context persistence path
  (`init`, `add`, `agent`, `status`, `drift`, `load`,
  `sync`, `compact`, `task`, `decision`, `learning`, and
  their siblings) is a single Go binary with no required
  runtime dependencies. Optional integrations (`ctx
  trace` (needs `git`), `ctx serve` (needs `zensical`),
  the `ctx` Hub (needs a running hub), Claude Code
  plugin (needs `claude`)) are opt-in and each declares
  its dependency explicitly.
* **CLI-driven**: every feature is reachable from the
  command line and scriptable.
* **developer-controlled**: no auto-updating cloud
  service, no telemetry, no account to sign up for.

The core `ctx` binary does not require:

* a server
* a database
* an account
* a SaaS backend
* network connectivity (for core operations)

`ctx` optimizes for *individual and small-team workflows* where context should
live next to code; **not** behind a service boundary.

## Specific Tool Comparisons

Users often evaluate `ctx` against specific tools they already use. These
comparisons clarify where responsibilities overlap, where they diverge, and
where the tools are genuinely complementary.

### Claude Code Memory / Anthropic Auto-Memory

Anthropic's auto-memory is **tool-managed memory (L2)**: the model decides
what to remember, stores it automatically, and retrieves it implicitly.
`ctx` is **system memory (L3)**: humans and agents explicitly curate
decisions, learnings, and tasks in inspectable files.

Auto-memory is convenient - you do not configure anything. But it is also
opaque: you cannot see what was stored, edit it precisely, or share it
across tools. `ctx` files are plain Markdown in your repository, visible
in diffs and code review.

The two are complementary. `ctx` can absorb auto-memory as an input source
(importing what the model remembered into structured context files) while
providing the durable, inspectable layer that auto-memory lacks.

### .Cursorrules / .Claude/rules

Static rule files (`.cursorrules`, `.claude/rules/`) declare conventions:
coding style, forbidden patterns, preferred libraries. They are effective
for **what to do** and load automatically at session start.

`ctx` adds dimensions that rule files do not cover: architectural
**decisions** with rationale, **learnings** discovered during development,
active **tasks**, and a **constitution** that governs agent behavior.
Critically, `ctx` context **accumulates** - each session can add to it,
and token budgeting ensures only the most relevant context is injected.

Use rule files for static conventions. Use `ctx` for evolving project
memory.

### Aider `--read` / `--watch`

Aider's `--read` flag injects file contents at session start; `--watch`
reloads them on change. The concept is similar to `ctx`'s "load" step:
make the agent aware of specific files.

The differences emerge beyond loading. Aider has no persistence model --
nothing the agent learns during a session is written back. There is no
token budgeting (large files consume the full context window), no priority
ordering across file types, and no structured format for decisions or
learnings. `ctx` provides the full lifecycle: load, accumulate, persist,
and budget.

### Copilot @Workspace

GitHub Copilot's `@workspace` performs workspace-wide code search. It
answers **"what code exists?"** - finding function definitions, usages,
and file structure across the repository.

`ctx` answers a different question: **"what did we decide?"** It stores
architectural intent, not code indices. Copilot's workspace search and
`ctx`'s project memory are orthogonal; one finds code, the other
preserves the reasoning behind it.

### Cline Memory

Cline's memory bank stores session context within the Cline extension.
The motivation is similar to `ctx`: help the agent remember across
sessions.

The key difference is portability. Cline memory is tied to Cline - it
does not transfer to Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, or any other tool.
`ctx` is tool-agnostic: context lives in plain files that any editor,
agent, or script can read. Switching tools does not mean losing memory.

## When `ctx` Is a Good Fit

`ctx` works best when:

* you want AI work to compound over time;
* architectural decisions matter;
* context must be inspectable;
* humans and AI must share the same source of truth;
* Git history should include *why*, not just *what*.

---

## When `ctx` Is Not the Right Tool

`ctx` is probably not what you want if:

* you only need one-off prompts;
* you rely exclusively on RAG;
* you want autonomous agents without a human-readable state;
* you require centralized enterprise control;
* you want black-box memory systems,

These are valid goals; just different ones.
