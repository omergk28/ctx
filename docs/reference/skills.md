## Skills

Skills are slash commands that run **inside your AI assistant** (*e.g.,
`/ctx-next`*), as opposed to CLI commands that run in your terminal
(*e.g., `ctx status`*). 

Skills give your agent structured workflows: It knows what to read, what to 
run, and when to ask. Most wrap one or more `ctx` CLI commands with 
opinionated behavior on top. 

!!! tip "Skills Are Best Used Conversationally"
    The beauty of `ctx` is that it's designed to be intuitive and 
    conversational, allowing you to interact with your AI assistant 
    naturally. That's why you don't have to memorize many of
    these skills.

    See the [**Prompting Guide**](../home/prompting-guide.md) for natural-language 
    triggers that invoke these skills conversationally.

    However, when you need a more precise control, you have the option
    to invoke the relevant skills directly.

## Session Lifecycle

Skills for starting, running, and ending a productive session.

!!! note "Session Ceremonies"
    Two skills in this group are **ceremony skills**: `/ctx-remember` (session
    start) and `/ctx-wrap-up` (session end). Unlike other skills that work
    conversationally, these should be invoked as **explicit slash commands**
    for completeness. See [Session Ceremonies](../recipes/session-ceremonies.md).

### `/ctx-remember`

Recall project context and present a structured readback.
**Ceremony skill**: invoke explicitly at session start.

**Wraps**: `ctx agent --budget 4000`, `ctx journal source --limit 3`,
reads TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md, LEARNINGS.md

**See also**: [Session Ceremonies](../recipes/session-ceremonies.md),
[The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md)

---

### `/ctx-status`

Show context summary (*files, token budget, tasks, recent activity*)
with interpreted suggestions.

**Wraps**: `ctx status [--verbose] [--json]`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[`ctx status` CLI](../cli/init-status.md#ctx-status)

---

### `/ctx-agent`

Load the full context packet optimized for AI consumption.
Also runs automatically via the PreToolUse hook with cooldown.

**Wraps**: `ctx agent [--budget] [--format] [--cooldown] [--session]`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[`ctx agent` CLI](../cli/init-status.md#ctx-agent)

---

### `/ctx-next`

Suggest 1-3 concrete next actions ranked by priority, momentum,
and unblocked status.

**Wraps**: reads TASKS.md, `ctx journal source --limit 3`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[Tracking Work Across Sessions](../recipes/task-management.md)

---

### `/ctx-commit`

Commit code with integrated context persistence: pre-commit checks,
staged files, Co-Authored-By trailer, and a post-commit prompt to
capture decisions and learnings.

**Wraps**: `git add`, `git commit`, optionally chains to
`/ctx-decision-add` and `/ctx-learning-add`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md)

---

### `/ctx-reflect`

Pause and reflect on session progress. Walks through a checklist of
learnings, decisions, task completions, and session notes to persist.

**Wraps**: chains to `ctx learning add`, `ctx decision add`,
manual TASKS.md updates

**See also**: [The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[Persisting Decisions, Learnings, and Conventions](../recipes/knowledge-capture.md)

---

### `/ctx-wrap-up`

End-of-session context persistence ceremony. Gathers signal from
git diff, recent commits, and conversation themes. Proposes
candidates (learnings, decisions, conventions, tasks) with complete
structured fields for user approval, then persists via `ctx add`.
Offers `/ctx-commit` if uncommitted changes remain. **Always
delegates to `/ctx-handover` as its final step**, regardless of
whether `.context/kb/` exists: KB presence only affects what gets
folded into the handover, not whether it is written.
**Ceremony skill**: invoke explicitly at session end.

**Trigger phrases**: "let's wrap up", "save context", "save
state", "leave a handover", "before I go", "stepping away",
"end of session"

**Wraps**: `git diff --stat`, `git log`, `ctx learning add`,
`ctx decision add`, `ctx convention add`, `ctx task add`,
chains to `/ctx-commit`, delegates to `/ctx-handover`

**See also**: [Session Ceremonies](../recipes/session-ceremonies.md),
[The Complete Session](../recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[`/ctx-handover`](#ctx-handover)

---

## Context Persistence

Skills for recording work artifacts: tasks, decisions, learnings,
conventions: into `.context/` files.

### `/ctx-task-add`

Add an actionable task with optional priority and phase section.

**Wraps**: `ctx task add "description" [--priority high|medium|low]
--session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH`

**See also**: [Tracking Work Across Sessions](../recipes/task-management.md)

---

### `/ctx-decision-add`

Record an architectural decision with context, rationale, and
consequence. Supports Y-statement (lightweight) and full ADR formats.

**Wraps**: `ctx decision add "title" --context "..." --rationale "..."
--consequence "..." --session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH`

**See also**:
[Persisting Decisions, Learnings, and Conventions](../recipes/knowledge-capture.md)

---

### `/ctx-learning-add`

Record a project-specific gotcha, bug, or unexpected behavior.
Filters for insights that are searchable, project-specific, and
required real effort to discover.

**Wraps**: `ctx learning add "title" --context "..." --lesson "..."
--application "..." --session-id ID --branch BR --commit HASH`

**See also**:
[Persisting Decisions, Learnings, and Conventions](../recipes/knowledge-capture.md)

**See also**:
[Persisting Decisions, Learnings, and Conventions](../recipes/knowledge-capture.md)

---

### `/ctx-archive`

Archive completed tasks from TASKS.md to a timestamped file in
`.context/archive/`. Preserves phase headers for traceability.

**Wraps**: `ctx task archive [--dry-run]`

**See also**: [Tracking Work Across Sessions](../recipes/task-management.md)

---

## Scratchpad

### `/ctx-pad`

Manage the encrypted scratchpad: add, remove, edit, and reorder
one-liner notes. Encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.

**Wraps**: `ctx pad`, `ctx pad add`, `ctx pad rm`, `ctx pad edit`,
`ctx pad mv`, `ctx pad import`, `ctx pad export`, `ctx pad merge`

**See also**: [Scratchpad](scratchpad.md),
[Using the Scratchpad](../recipes/scratchpad-with-claude.md)

---

## Journal & History

Skills for browsing, exporting, and enriching your AI session history
into a structured journal.

### `/ctx-history`

Browse, inspect, and import AI session history. List recent sessions,
show details by slug or ID, and import to `.context/journal/`.

**Wraps**: `ctx journal source`, `ctx journal source --show`, `ctx journal import`

**See also**:
[Browsing and Enriching Past Sessions](../recipes/session-archaeology.md)

---

### `/ctx-journal-enrich`

Enrich a single journal entry with YAML frontmatter: title, type,
outcome, topics, technologies, and summary. Shows diff before writing.

**Wraps**: reads and edits `.context/journal/*.md` files

**See also**:
[Browsing and Enriching Past Sessions](../recipes/session-archaeology.md),
[Turning Activity into Content](../recipes/publishing.md)

---

### `/ctx-journal-enrich-all`

Full journal pipeline: imports unimported sessions first, then
batch-enriches all unenriched entries. Filters out short sessions
and continuations. Can spawn subagents for large backlogs.

**Wraps**: `ctx journal import --all` + iterates `/ctx-journal-enrich`

**See also**:
[Browsing and Enriching Past Sessions](../recipes/session-archaeology.md)

---

## Content Creation

Skills for turning project activity into publishable content.

### `/ctx-blog`

Generate a blog post draft from recent project activity: git history,
decisions, learnings, tasks, and journal entries. Requires a narrative
arc (problem, approach, outcome).

**Wraps**: reads `git log`, DECISIONS.md, LEARNINGS.md, TASKS.md,
journal entries; writes to `docs/blog/`

**See also**: [Turning Activity into Content](../recipes/publishing.md)

---

### `/ctx-blog-changelog`

Generate a themed blog post from a commit range. Takes a starting
commit and unifying theme, analyzes diffs and journal entries from
that period.

**Wraps**: `git log`, `git diff --stat`; writes to `docs/blog/`

**See also**: [Turning Activity into Content](../recipes/publishing.md)

---

## Auditing & Health

Skills for detecting drift, auditing alignment, and improving
prompt quality.

### `/ctx-consolidate`

Consolidate redundant entries in LEARNINGS.md or DECISIONS.md. Groups
overlapping entries by keyword similarity, presents candidates, and
(*with user approval*) merges groups into denser combined entries.
Originals are archived, not deleted.

**Wraps**: reads LEARNINGS.md and DECISIONS.md, writes consolidated
entries, archives originals, runs `ctx reindex`

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](../recipes/context-health.md)

---

### `/ctx-drift`

Detect and fix context drift: stale paths, missing files, file age
staleness, task accumulation, entry count warnings, and constitution
violations via `ctx drift`. Also detects skill drift against canonical
templates.

**Wraps**: `ctx drift [--fix]`

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](../recipes/context-health.md)

---

### `/ctx-prompt-audit`

Analyze recent prompting patterns to identify vague or ineffective
prompts. Reviews 3-5 journal entries and suggests rewrites with
positive observations.

**Wraps**: reads `.context/journal/` entries

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](../recipes/context-health.md)

---

### `/ctx-doctor`

Troubleshoot `ctx` behavior. Runs structural health checks via `ctx doctor`,
analyzes event log patterns via `ctx hook event`, and presents findings
with suggested actions. The CLI provides the structural baseline; the agent
adds semantic analysis of event patterns and correlations.

**Wraps**: `ctx doctor --json`, `ctx hook event --json --last 100`,
`ctx remind list`, `ctx hook message list`, reads `.ctxrc`

**Trigger phrases**: "diagnose", "troubleshoot", "doctor", "health check",
"why didn't my hook fire?", "hooks seem broken", "something seems off"

**Graceful degradation**: If `event_log` is not enabled, the skill still
works but with reduced capability. It runs structural checks and notes:
"Enable `event_log: true` in `.ctxrc` for hook-level diagnostics."

**See also**: [Troubleshooting](../recipes/troubleshooting.md),
[`ctx doctor` CLI](../cli/doctor.md#ctx-doctor),
[`ctx hook event` CLI](../cli/event.md#ctx-hook-event)

---

### `/ctx-link-check`

Scan all Markdown files under `docs/` for broken links. Three passes:
internal links (verify file targets exist on disk), external links
(HTTP HEAD with timeout, report failures as warnings), and image
references. Resolves relative paths, strips anchors before checking,
and skips localhost/example URLs.

**Wraps**: Glob + Grep to scan, `curl` for external checks

**Trigger phrases**: "check links", "audit links", "any broken links?",
"dead links"

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](../recipes/context-health.md)

---

### `/ctx-permission-sanitize`

Audit `.claude/settings.local.json` for dangerous permissions across
four risk categories: hook bypass (*Critical*), destructive commands
(*High*), config injection vectors (*High*), and overly broad patterns
(*Medium*). Reports findings by severity and offers specific fix actions
with user confirmation.

**Wraps**: reads `.claude/settings.local.json`, edits with confirmation

**Trigger phrases**: "audit permissions", "are my permissions safe?",
"sanitize permissions", "check settings"

**See also**:
[Claude Code Permission Hygiene](../recipes/claude-code-permissions.md)

---

## Planning & Execution

Skills for structured design, implementation, and parallel agent
workflows.

### `/ctx-brainstorm`

Transform raw ideas into clear, validated designs through structured
dialogue before any implementation begins. Follows a gated process:
understand context, clarify the idea (one question at a time),
surface non-functional requirements, lock understanding with user
confirmation, explore 2-3 design approaches with trade-offs,
stress-test the chosen approach, and present the detailed design.

**Wraps**: reads DECISIONS.md, relevant source files; chains to
`/ctx-decision-add` for recording design choices

**Trigger phrases**: "let's brainstorm", "design this", "think through",
"before we build", "what approach should we take?"

**See also**:
[`/ctx-spec`](#ctx-spec)

---

### `/ctx-spec`

Scaffold a feature spec from the project template and walk through
each section with the user. Covers: problem, approach, happy path,
edge cases, validation rules, error handling, interface, implementation,
configuration, testing, and non-goals. Spends extra time on edge cases
and error handling.

**Wraps**: reads `specs/tpl/spec-template.md`, writes to `specs/`,
optionally chains to `/ctx-task-add`

**Trigger phrases**: "spec this out", "write a spec", "create a spec",
"design document"

#### `--brief <path>` flag

When invoked as `/ctx-spec --brief <path>`, the skill treats the
file at `<path>` as the authoritative source and skips the
interactive Q&A. Use this when a prior `/ctx-plan` session
produced a debated brief that already covers the design.

The skill enforces this **authority order** when sources disagree:

1. Frozen contracts in `docs/` (release notes, public CLI docs)
2. Recorded decisions in `.context/DECISIONS.md`
3. The brief at `<path>`
4. Agent inference, only when 1 through 3 are silent, and
   labeled `TBD` in the resulting spec so it stands out for
   review.

Light compression for clarity is allowed; new facts are not.
Where the brief is silent, the spec writes `TBD` rather than
filling the gap from inference. If the brief contradicts a
frozen contract, the contradiction is surfaced to the user
rather than silently followed.

[`/ctx-brainstorm`](#ctx-brainstorm),
[`/ctx-plan`](#ctx-plan),
[`/ctx-plan-import`](#ctx-plan-import)

---

### `/ctx-plan-import`

Import Claude Code plan files (`~/.claude/plans/*.md`) into the project's
`specs/` directory. Lists plans with dates and H1 titles, supports
filtering (`--today`, `--since`, `--all`), slugifies headings for
filenames, and optionally creates tasks referencing each imported spec.

**Wraps**: reads `~/.claude/plans/*.md`, writes to `specs/`,
optionally chains to `/ctx-task-add`

**See also**:
[Importing Claude Code Plans](../recipes/import-plans.md),
[Tracking Work Across Sessions](../recipes/task-management.md)

---

### `/ctx-implement`

Execute a multi-step plan with build and test verification at each
step. Loads a plan from a file or conversation context, breaks it
into atomic steps, and checkpoints after every 3-5 steps.

**Wraps**: reads plan file, runs verification commands
(`go build`, `go test`, etc.)

[Running an Unattended AI Agent](../recipes/autonomous-loops.md)

---

### `/ctx-loop`

Generate a ready-to-run shell script for autonomous AI iteration.
Supports Claude Code, Aider, and generic tool templates with
configurable completion signals.

**Wraps**: `ctx loop [--tool] [--prompt] [--max-iterations]
[--completion] [--output]`

**See also**: [Autonomous Loops](../operations/autonomous-loop.md),
[Running an Unattended AI Agent](../recipes/autonomous-loops.md)

---

### `/ctx-worktree`

Manage git worktrees for parallel agent development. Create sibling
worktrees on dedicated branches, analyze task blast radius for
grouping, and tear down with merge.

**Wraps**: `git worktree add`, `git worktree list`,
`git worktree remove`, `git merge`

**See also**:
[Parallel Agent Development with Git Worktrees](../recipes/parallel-worktrees.md)

---

### `/ctx-architecture`

Build and maintain architecture maps incrementally. Creates or refreshes
`ARCHITECTURE.md` (*succinct project map, loaded at session start*) and
`DETAILED_DESIGN.md` (*deep per-module reference, consulted on-demand*).
Coverage is tracked in `map-tracking.json` so each run extends the map
rather than re-analyzing everything.

**Wraps**: `ctx status`, `git log`, reads source files; writes
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DETAILED_DESIGN.md`, `map-tracking.json`

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](../recipes/context-health.md)

### `/ctx-architecture-failure-analysis`

Adversarial failure analysis that generates falsifiable incident
hypotheses against architecture artifacts. Hunts for correctness
bugs that survive code review and tests: race conditions, ordering
assumptions, cache staleness, error swallowing, ownership gaps,
idempotency failures, state machine drift, and scaling cliffs.

Requires `/ctx-architecture` artifacts as input. Reads
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DETAILED_DESIGN*.md`, and `map-tracking.json`,
then systematically applies 9 failure categories to every mutation
point. Each finding carries an evidence standard (code path,
trigger, failure path, silence reason, code evidence), a confidence
level, and an explicit risk score. A mandatory challenge phase
attempts to disprove each finding before it is accepted.

Produces `.context/DANGER-ZONES.md` with ranked findings split
into Critical (risk >= 7, silent/cascading) and Elevated tiers.

**Wraps**: reads architecture artifacts, source code; writes
`DANGER-ZONES.md`. Optionally uses a code-intelligence MCP
(canonical: GitNexus) for blast radius and a
web-search-with-citations MCP (canonical: Gemini Search) for
cross-referencing known failure patterns.

**Relationship**:

| Skill | Mode |
|-------|------|
| `/ctx-architecture` | Map what exists |
| `/ctx-architecture-enrich` | Improve map fidelity |
| `/ctx-architecture-failure-analysis` | Generate falsifiable incident hypotheses |

### `/ctx-remind`

Manage session-scoped reminders via natural language. Translates user
intent (*"remind me to refactor swagger"*) into the corresponding
`ctx remind` command. Handles date conversion for `--after` flags.

**Wraps**: `ctx remind`, `ctx remind list`, `ctx remind dismiss`

**See also**:
[Session Reminders](../recipes/session-reminders.md)

## Skill Authoring

### `/ctx-skill-audit`

Audit one or more skills against Anthropic prompting best practices.
Checks audit dimensions: positive framing, motivation, phantom references,
examples, subagent guards, scope, and descriptions. Reports findings by
severity with concrete fix suggestions.

**Wraps**: reads `internal/assets/claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` or
`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, references `anthropic-best-practices.md`

**Trigger phrases**: "audit this skill", "check skill quality",
"review the skills", "are our skills any good?"

**See also**: [`/ctx-skill-create`](#ctx-skill-create),
[Contributing](../home/contributing.md)

---

### `/ctx-skill-create`

Create, improve, and test skills. Guides the full lifecycle: capture
intent, interview for edge cases, draft the SKILL.md, test with
realistic prompts, review results with the user, and iterate. Applies
core principles: the agent is already smart (only add what it does
not know), the description is the trigger (make it specific and
"pushy"), and explain the why instead of rigid directives.

**Wraps**: reads/writes `.claude/skills/` and
`internal/assets/claude/skills/`

**Trigger phrases**: "create a skill", "turn this into a skill",
"make a slash command", "this should be a skill", "improve this skill",
"the skill isn't triggering"

## Session Control

Skills for controlling hook behavior during a session.

### `/ctx-pause`

Pause all context nudge and reminder hooks for the current session.
Security hooks still fire. Use for quick investigations or tasks that
don't need ceremony overhead.

**Wraps**: `ctx hook pause`

**Trigger phrases**: "pause `ctx`", "pause context", "stop the nudges",
"quiet mode"

**See also**:
[Pausing Context Hooks](../recipes/session-pause.md)

---

### `/ctx-resume`

Resume context hooks after a pause. Restores normal nudge, reminder,
and ceremony behavior. Silent no-op if not paused.

**Wraps**: `ctx hook resume`

**Trigger phrases**: "resume `ctx`", "resume context", "turn nudges back on",
"unpause"

**See also**:
[Pausing Context Hooks](../recipes/session-pause.md)

## Knowledge Base (Phase KB)

Skills for the editorial knowledge-ingestion pipeline. Active when
`.context/kb/` exists (laid down by `ctx init`). The pipeline gives
you evidence-tracked knowledge with confidence bands, folder-shaped
topic pages, a source-coverage state machine, and per-session
handovers that fold postdated closeouts.

See the
[Build a Knowledge Base recipe](../recipes/build-a-knowledge-base.md)
for the full workflow. The editorial constitution lives at
`.context/ingest/KB-RULES.md`.

### `/ctx-kb-ingest`

Mode-aware editorial pass. Declares its pass-mode
(`topic-page` / `triage` / `evidence-only`) up front, scans the
source-coverage ledger for adjacent incomplete topics, synthesizes
prose into `.context/kb/topics/<slug>/index.md`, mints `EV-###`
rows in `evidence-index.md`, runs a four-invariant completion
circuit breaker, and writes a closeout under
`.context/ingest/closeouts/`. Refuses on empty input.

**Wraps**: `ctx kb ingest`, `ctx kb topic new`, the writer
packages under `internal/write/kb/`.

**Trigger phrases**: "ingest the transcripts", "pull this into the
kb", "add evidence from"

**See also**:
[Build a Knowledge Base](../recipes/build-a-knowledge-base.md),
[Typical KB Session](../recipes/typical-kb-session.md),
[`ctx kb` CLI](../cli/kb.md#ctx-kb)

---

### `/ctx-kb-ask`

Q&A grounded in the KB. Cites `EV-###` rows; refuses to web-jump.
When the KB cannot answer, opens a `Q-###` row in
`outstanding-questions.md` rather than inventing. Refuses on empty
question.

**Wraps**: `ctx kb ask`, reads `.context/kb/*.md`

**Trigger phrases**: "does the kb say", "according to evidence"

**See also**: [`ctx kb` CLI](../cli/kb.md#ctx-kb)

---

### `/ctx-kb-site-review`

Mechanical structural audit. Coerces malformed Confidence-band
capitalization, flags malformed closeout frontmatter, refuses
judgment calls that require evidence (those go through ingest).

**Wraps**: `ctx kb site-review`

**Trigger phrases**: "audit the kb", "check kb for rot"

**See also**: [`ctx kb` CLI](../cli/kb.md#ctx-kb)

---

### `/ctx-kb-ground`

External re-grounding pass. Reads
`.context/ingest/grounding-sources.md` and refreshes each listed
source. Refuses cleanly when the file is absent or empty.

**Wraps**: `ctx kb ground`

**Trigger phrases**: "re-ground the kb", "check upstream"

**See also**: [`ctx kb` CLI](../cli/kb.md#ctx-kb)

---

### `/ctx-kb-note`

Lightweight capture into `.context/ingest/findings.md`. Never
writes to a topic page or `evidence-index.md`. Use for parking
findings the next ingest pass should absorb.

**Wraps**: `ctx kb note "<text>"`

**Trigger phrases**: "drop a note", "park this finding"

**See also**: [`ctx kb` CLI](../cli/kb.md#ctx-kb)

---

### `/ctx-handover`

Per-session handover artifact writer; the sub-mechanism that
`/ctx-wrap-up` delegates to as its final step. Collects
`--summary` (past tense) and `--next` (future tense, specific)
and calls `ctx handover write`. Writes the handover to
`.context/handovers/<TS>-<slug>.md` (timestamped so concurrent
agent runs never overwrite). Folds postdated closeouts into a
`## Folded closeouts` section and **physically archives** the
source closeouts under `.context/archive/closeouts/` (closeouts
are append-never-rewrite; archival moves bytes but does not
modify them). `--no-fold` skips the fold for mid-session
checkpoints.

**Mandatory tail of `/ctx-wrap-up`.** Direct invocation is
reserved for `--no-fold` mid-session checkpoints and recovery
after an aborted session.

**Wraps**: `ctx handover write <title> --summary X --next Y`

**See also**:
[`/ctx-wrap-up`](#ctx-wrap-up),

## Project-Specific Skills

The `ctx` plugin ships the skills listed above.
Teams can add their own project-specific skills to `.claude/skills/` in the
project root: These are separate from plugin-shipped skills and are scoped
to the project.

Project-specific skills follow the same format and are invoked the same way.

Custom skills are not covered in this reference.
